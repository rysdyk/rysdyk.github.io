			<h2>Notes &amp; Quotes</h2>
				<p>"It took me a long time to understand that even a stubborn mule responds to gentleness." - Wooden on his father's example of being strong but gentle.</p>
				<p>"He was the kind of man I set out to be. He was the model."</p>
				<p>Father's two sets of threes:
					<br>
					on honesty:
					<ul>
						<li>Never Lie</li>
						<li>Never Cheat</li>
						<li>Never Steal</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					dealing with adversity:
					<ul>
						<li>Don't Whine</li>
						<li>Don't Complain</li>
						<li>Don't Make Execuses</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>From Reverend Henry Van Dyke:<br>
				Four things a man must learn to do<br>
				If he would make his life more true:<br>
				To think without confusion clearly,<br>
				To love his fellow-man sincerely,<br>
				To act from honest motives purely, <br>
				To trust in God and Heaven securely.<br>
				</p>
				<p>On the other side of the paper, Dad wrote out Seven Things to Do:
				<ul>
					<li>Be true to yourself</li>
					<li>Help others</li>
					<li>Make each day your masterpiece</li>
					<li>Drink deeply from good books, especially the Bible</li>
					<li>Make friendship a fine art</li>
					<li>Build a shelter against a rainy day</li>
					<li>Pray for guidance and count and give thanks for your blessings every day</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>On each of those:
				<ul>
					<li>You must have the courage to be true to yourself</li>
					<li>Ralph Waldo Emerson said: "rings and jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts. The only true gift is a portion of thyself."</li>
					<li>By applying yourself to the take of becoming a little better each and every day over a period of time, you will become <i>a lot</i> better.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>"Don't think you can make up for it by working twice as hard tomorrow. If you have it within your power to work twice as hard, why aren't you doing it now?"</li>
						</ul>
					<li>The poetry Dad read to us when were kids instilled a love of reading, English, books, and knowledge.</li>
					<li>You must work at friendship. Make it a fine art. Friendship is being a friend.</li>
					<li>This is not necessarily a material shelter.</li>
					<li>A wise person once observed, "How much more pleasant this world would be if we magnified our blessings the way we magnify our disappointments."</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Happiness, freedom, and piece of mind are always attained when we give them to others.</p>
				<p>"Never believe you're better than anybody else, but remember that you're just as good as everybody else."</p>
				<p>"Family is first. Always. Always."</p>
				<p>The greatest word in the whole dictionary is love.</p>
				<p>No written word<br>
					nor spoken plea<br>
					Can teach our youth<br>
					what they should be.<br>

					Nor all the books<br>
					on all the shelves.<br>
					It's what the teachers<br>
					are themselves<br>

				<p>"The goal in life is just the same as in basketball: make the effort to do the best you are capable of doing . . . The <i>effort</i> is what counts in everything."</p>
				<p>Perfection is impossible. However, <i>striving</i> for perfection is not an impossibility.</p>
				<p>Learn Forever, Die Tomorrow - learn like you are going to live forever, don't waste time as if you were going to die tomorrow.</p>
				<p>"You often find what you are looking for."</p>
				<p>"I believe the greatest joy one can have is doing something for someone else without any thought of getting something in return."</p>
				<p>"Control your temper and don't use profanity."</p>
				<p>After college a professional basketball team offered him 5K to come play basketball. That was big money back then -- about 4x what he would make teaching. He went to his coach for advice on whether to accept the offer. Coach asked him why he came to college. Wooden then realized he came to college to become a teacher and a coach. He decided to turn down the offer and stay true to himself.  "You'll usually do all right, though, if you have the courage to be true to yourself."</p>
				<p>"I also believe that things turn out best for those who make the best of the way things turn out."</p>
				<p>Six ways to bring out the best in people
				<ul>
					<li>Keep courtesy and consideration for others foremost in your mind, at home and away.</li>
					<li>Try to have fun without trying to be funny.</li>
					<li>While you can't control what happens to you, you can control how you react. Make good manners an automatic reaction.</li>
					<li>Seek individual opportunities to offer a genuine compliment.</li>
					<li>Remember that sincerity, optimism, and enthusiasm are more welcome than sarcasm, pessimism, and laziness.</li>
					<li>Laugh with others, never at them.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>"Set your compass in a chosen direction and then focus your attention and efforts completely on the journey of preparation. A successful journey becomes your destination and is where your real accomplishment lies."</p>
				<p>"I informed every player who came under my supervision that the outcome of a game was simply a by-product of the effort we made to prepare."</p>
				<p>"You never fail if you know in your heart that you did the best of which you are capable. I did my best. That is all I could do."</p>
				<p>"Only one person on earth knows if you made you best effort. . .  You can fool everyone else."</p>
				<p>"Learn from the past, don't live in the past."</p>
				<p>Wooden never assume they would lose, even when they were big underdogs, but he would never assume they would win either.</p>
				<p>Things don't always work out. If you can learn from it, fine, but never second guess yourself. Its wasted effort.</p>
				<p>"I believe one of my strengths is my ability to keep negative thoughts out. I am an optimist. I believe this results from the fact that I set realistic goals -- ones that are difficult to achieve, but within reach. You might say I'm a realistic optimist."</p>
				<p>"You will find that success and attention to details, the smallest details, usually go hand in hand, in basketball and elsewhere in life." For example, at the very first practice Coach would teach the youngsters how to put on their socks. Any wrinkles could cause blisters. Coach didn't overlook small details.</p>
				<p>Don't think big, think positively. Hoping for the impossible is unproductive. If you're not seven feet tall, you're not seven feet tall. But go for the "difficult but possible."</p>
				<p>"Mix idealism with realism and add hard work."</p>
				<p>"What joy can be derived in sports from overcoming someone who is not as capable as you are? But there is great joy and satisfaction in competing against an opponent who forces you to dig deep and produce your best."</p>
				<p>"Too often the big talkers are the little doers."</p>
				<p>You cannot overachieve. You either achieve or underachieve.</p>
				<p>Eight Suggestions for Success:
				<ul>
					<li>Fear no opponent. Respect every opponent.</li>
					<li>Remember, its the perfection of the smallest details that make big things happen.</li>
					<li>Keep in mind that hustle makes up for many a mistake.</li>
					<li>Be more interested in character than reputation.</li>
					<li>Be quick, but don't hurry.</li>
					<li>Understand that the harder you work, the more luck you will have.</li>
					<li>Know that valid self-analysis is crucial for improvement.</li>
					<li>Remember that there is no substitute for hard work and careful planning. Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Coach Piggy Lambert of Purdue said: "The team that makes the most mistakes will probably win." The <i>doer</i> makes mistakes. Mistakes come from doing, but so does success.</p>
				<p>"I think neatness and courtesy make you feel good about yourself. I believe individuals who feel good about themselves are more productive."</p>
				<p>Nine Promises that can bring happiness:
				<ul>
					<li>Promise yourself that you will talk health, happiness, and prosperity as often as possible.
				</li>
					<li>Promise yourself to make all your friends know there is something in them that is special and that you value.</li>
					<li>Promise to think only of the best, to work only for the best, and to expect only the best in yourself and others.</li>
					<li>Promise to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.</li>
					<li>Promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind</li>
					<li>Promise to forget the mistakes of the past and press on to greater achievements in the future.</li>
					<li>Promise to wear a cheerful appearance at all times and give every person you meet a smile.</li>
					<li>Promise to give so much time to improving yourself that you have no time to criticize others.</li>
					<li>Promise to be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy to permit trouble to press on you.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>"I never mentioned winning or victory to my players. I never referred to "beating" an opponent. Instead I constantly urged them to strive for the self-satisfaction that always comes from knowing you did the best you could to become the best of which you are capable."</p>
				<p>"Don't measure yourself by what you've accomplished, but rather by what you should have accomplished with your abilities."</p>
				<p>"Don't compare yourself to somebody else, especially materially . . . It's a guaranteed way to make yourself miserable. Envy, jealousy, and criticism can become cancerous."</p>
				<p>"Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent." - Calvin Coolidge</p>
				<p>One of coach's most common expressions was "move, move,  move." He meant it physically and mentally. In practice they would do a play. Then, they would do it again but faster. Then again but faster. It to the point where games seemed like they were happening in slow motion. </p>
				<p>"balance means keeping things in proper perspective, not permitting either excessive exuberance or dejection to interfere with preparation, performance, or subsequent individual or team behavior." In life we must have balance too.</p>
				<p>The worst punishment of all: "Gentlemen, practice is over." Practice was a privilege.</p>
				<p>"Develop a love for details. They usually accompany success."</p>
				<p>"I believe performing with style and class is a first priority, especially if you're in the public spotlight. If you're in that position, you do have a responsibility."</p>
				<p>"Don't look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time."</p>
				<p>Talent is God-given: be humble.<br>
				Fame is man-given: be thankful.<br>
				Conceit is self-given: be careful.
				</p>
				<p>How to be a champion by Grantland Rice<br><br>

				You wonder how they do it,<br>
				You look to see the knack,<br>
				You watch the foot in action,<br>
				Or the shoulder or the back.<br><br>

				But when you spot the answer<br>
				Where the higher glamours lurk,<br>
				You'll find in moving higher<br>
				Up the laurel-covered spire,<br>
				That most of it is practice,<br>
				And the rest of it is work.
				</p>
				<p>Somebody told Lincoln "Mr. President, you're supposed to destroy your enemies, not make friends of them!" Mr Lincoln replied, "Am I not destroying an enemy when I make a friend of him?"</p>
				<p>"Success is giving 100 percent of your effort, body, mind, and soul, to the struggle. That you can attain. That is success."</p>
