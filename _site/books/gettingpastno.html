      <h1>Getting Past No by William Ury</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>1. Get Ready</p>
<p>"Diplomacy is the art of letting someone else have your way." - Daniele Vare
</p>
<p>Take a "joint problem-solving" approach. Focus on the problem not the people. Instead of attacking each other, jointly attack the problem.</p>
<p>5 Barriers to Cooperation:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Your Reaction
			<ol>
				<li>The first barrier lies within you.</li>
				<li>Don't just strike back to strike back, but don't give in either.</li>
				<li>Suspend your reaction.</li>
				<li>"Go to the "Balcony".</li>
			</ol>	
		</li>
		<li>Their Emotion
			<ol>
				<li>Try seeing things for their point of view.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Their position
			<ol>
				<li>What are their real interests</li>
				<li>Every man has two reasons for doing a thing -- the one he says, and the real one.</li>
				<li>Say "tell me more" and "how do you mean"</li>
				<li>Reframe</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Their Dissatisfaction
			<ol>
				<li>Build a golden bridge</li>
				<li> Help them save face and make the outcome look as good for them as possible.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Their Power
			<ol>
				<li>Don't use power to escalate, but to educate</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The great home run hitter Sadahara Oh, the Japanese Babe Ruth, looked at every opposing pitcher as his partner, with every pitch as an opportunity.</p>
	<p>Treat your opponent as a negotiating partner.</p>
	<p>Rather than telling them what to do, you let them figure it out. Your job is to help them.</p>
	<p>"Before every meeting, prepare. After every meeting, assess your progress, adapt your strategy, and prepare again."</p>
	<p>Mapping a way to agreement:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Interests
				<ol>
					<li>Figure out your interests.</li>
					<li>Figure out their interests.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Options
				<ol>
					<li>Don't just divvy up the pie, make the pie bigger</li>
					<li>A classic mistake is to focus on a single solution, you need options</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Standards
				<ol>
					<li>Rely heavily on fair, independent standards</li>
					<li>Market value, the law, or usual practices can be such standards</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Alternatives
				<ol>
					<li>BATNA = Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement</li>
					<li>Your BATNA is your walkaway alternative. The ability to walkaway.</li>
					<li>BATNA is the key to negotiating power.</li>
					<li>Identify and boost your BATNA</li>
					<li>Identify their BATNA</li>
					<li>Figure out a solution that is better than BOTH sides' BATNA</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	<br />
	<p>Break Through Strategies:</p>
	<p><strong>1. Don't React: Go to the Balcony</strong></p>
	<p>"Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret." - Ambrose Bierce</p>
	<p>The natural reactions: striking back, giving in, breaking off</p>
	<p>Remember, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction</p>
	<p>The "balcony" is a metaphor for a mental attitude of detachment.</p>
	<p>Imagine yourself on the stage, then imagine yourself on the balcony overlooking the state.</p>
	<p>Name the Game:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Stone Walls
				<ol>
					<li>Ex: "I can't do anything about it."</li>
					<li>A good tactic is to ignore it</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Attacks
				<ol>
					<li>Ex: "Do it or else!"</li>
					<li>Ignore it, or make a joke about</li>
					<li>Don't take it personally</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Tricks
				<ol>
					<li>Expose them</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	<p>"We live and work in competitive environments. So expect verbal attacks and don't take them personally."</p>
	<p>Accusers are trying to get a reaction out of you. Deny them that.</p>
	<p>Once you have named the gamed (See above) go out to the balcony.</p>
	<p>Take a time out. Make an excuse for a short break. Just get out of the room for second.</p>
	<p>"Never make an important decision on the spot. Go to the balcony and make it there."</p>
	<p>Don't get mad, Don't get even, Get what you want</p>
	<br />
	<p><strong>2. Don't Argue: Step to Their Side</strong></p>
	<p>You can't reason with a person who is not receptive.</p>
	<p>The secret of disarming is surprise.</p>
	<p>Listen actively. Hear the other side out.</p>
	<p>When they are done talking. Encourage them to keep talking. Real reasons may emerge at the very end.</p>
	<p>"Effective negotiators listen far more than they talk."</p>
	<p>Paraphrase what they are saying and acknowledge their points.</p>
	<p>Agree, without conceding, wherever you can.</p>
	<p>Accumulate Yeses. The key word in agreement is "yes."</p>
	<p>Acknowledge the person and distinguish between the person and the behavior.</p>
	<p>Express your views without provoking. Instead of either/or, use both/and</p>
	<p>Don't say "But," say "Yes... And" <br />
NEVER say "but". SAY "and". Customer says prices are too high. You say, "and our quality is too high."</p>
	<br />
	<p><strong>3. Don't Reject: Reframe</strong></p>
	<p>Reframing is talking about the problem. Focus on the problem, not the people involved.</p>
	<p>Ask problem solving questions. "Why?" "Why not?" "What if?"</p>
	<p>Ask for their advice.</p>
	<p>Ask "What makes that fair?"</p>
	<p>Don't ask leading questions. Make your questions open-ended.</p>
	<br />
	<p><strong>4. Don't Push: Build Them A Golden Bridge</strong></p>
	<p>"Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across." - Sun Tzu</p>
	<p>Obstacles to Agreement:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Not their idea</li>
		<li>Unmet interests</li>
		<li>Fear of losing face</li>
		<li>Too much too fast</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Always help them save face.</p>
	<p>They should be able to go back home and have people think they did well.</p>
	<br />
	<p><strong>5. Don't Escalate: Use Power to Educate</strong></p>
	<p>"The best general is the one who never fights." - Sun Tzu</p>
	<p>The power paradox: the harder you make it for them to say no, the harder you make it for them to say yes</p>
	<p>Use power to bring them to their senses, not to their knees</p>
	<p>Let them know the consequences.</p>
	<p>Ask reality-testing questions:</p>
	<p>Demonstrate your BATNA</p>
	<p>Warn, don't threaten</p>
	<p>Use the minimum power necessary, use legitimate means</p>
	<p>Tap the third force: build a coalition and bring in third parties on your side</p>
	<br />
	<p><strong>Finally: From Adversaries to Partners</strong></p>
	<p>"Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?" - Lincoln</p>
