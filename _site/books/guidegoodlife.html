      <h1>A Guide to the Good Life (the Ancient Art of Stoic Joy) by William Irvine</h1>
      <br>
"Vain is the word of a philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man. For just as there is no profit in medicine if it does not expel the diseases of the body, so there is no profit in philosophy either, if it does not expel the suffering of the mind." - Epicurus
 <br>
 <br>
"The goal of the Stoics was not to banish emotion from life but to banish negative emotion."
 <br>
 <br>
Today, pastors talk about being a good person, and having a good afterlife, but rarely do they specifically deal with having a good life.
 <br>
 <br>
History: "The stoics fell somewhere between the Cyrenaics and the Cynics: They though people should enjoy the good things life has to offer, including friendship and wealth, but only if they did not cling to these good things. Indeed, they thought we should periodically interrupt our enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating the loss of whatever it is we are enjoying."
 <br>
 <br>
Compliment to a stoic: "His conduct is exemplary. He doesn't let anything stop him from doing his duty. Although he drinks wine, he doesn't do so in order to get drunk."
 <br>
 <br>
"the phrase 'joyful stoic' is not an oxymoron."
 <br>
 <br>
"Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness -- all of them due to the offenders' ignorance of what is good or evil." - Marcus Aurelius
 <br>
 <br>
Marcus was an exceptionally good Roman emperor. "To finance wars, he auctioned off imperial possessions, including statues, paintings, gold vases, and some of his wife's jewelry and clothing rather than raise taxes."
 <br>
 <br>
Technique: "Negative Visualization" -- We should contemplate bad things that could happen to us. We will lessen their impact on us when/if they happen.
 <br>
 <br>
Epictetus advice: "In the very act of kissing the child, we should silently reflect on the possibility that she will die tomorrow." Marcus Aurelius approved of this quote. "In other words, when the stoics counsel us to live each day as if it were our last, their goal is not to change our activities but to change our state of mind as we carry out those activities."
 <br>
 <br>
"we tend to take for granted things that our ancestors had to live without, including antibiotics, air conditioning, toilet paper, cell phones, television, windows, eyeglasses, and fresh fruit in January."
 <br>
 <br>
There is a difference between <i>contemplating</i> something bad happening and <i>worrying </i> about it.
 <br>
 <br>
Why we should occasionally practice poverty: "By exposing ourselves to a small amount of a weakened virus now, we create in ourselves an immunity that will protect us from a debilitating illness in the future. Alternatively, voluntary discomfort can be thought of as an insurance premium which, if paid, makes us eligible for benefits: Should we later fall victim to a misfortune, the discomfort we experience then will be substantially less than it otherwise would have been."
 <br>
 <br>
"The more pleasures a man captures, 'the more masters will he have to serve.'"
 <br>
 <br>
"A stoic's mind, in contrast, will be quite active during a bedtime meditation. He will think about the events of the day. Did something disrupt his tranquility? Did he experience anger? Envy? Lust? Why did the day's events upset him? Is there something he could have done to avoid getting upset?"
 <br>
 <br>
"In the Meditations, Marcus explains the nature of this social duty. The gods, he says, created us for a reason -- created us, as he puts it, "for some duty." In the same way that the function of a fig tree is to do a fig tree's work, the function of a dog is to do a dog's work, and the function of a bee is to do a bee's work, the function of a man is to do a man's work -- to perform, that is, the function for which the gods created us."
 <br>
 <br>
"Indeed, when we awaken in the morning, rather than lazily lying in bed, we should tell ourselves that we must get up to do the proper work of man, the work we were created to perform."
 <br>
 <br>
"Thus, when it is possible to do so, we should avoid associating with people whose values have been corrupted, the way we would avoid, say, kissing someone who obviously has the flu."
 <br>
 <br>
"Marcus recommends that when we interact with an annoying person, we keep in mind that there are doubtless people who find us to be annoying."
 <br>
 <br>
"A good stoic, Marcus says, will not think about what other people are thinking except when he must do so in order to serve the public interest."
 <br>
 <br>
"If we analyze something into the elements that compose it, we will see the thing for what it really is and thereby value it appropriately." Marcus discovered sex is nothing more than "friction of the members and an ejaculatory discharge." "We would therefore be foolish to place a high value on sexual relations and more foolish still to disrupt our life in order to experience such relations."
 <br>
 <br>
Epictetus says: "another person will not do you harm unless you wish it; you will be harmed at just that time at which you take yourself to be harmed."
 <br>
 <br>
"If in the course of trying to rain a horse, we punish him, it should be because we want him to obey us in the future, not because we are angry about his failure to obey us in the past."
 <br>
 <br>
"The belief that stoics never grieve, although widely held, is mistaken." Seneca writes: "Nature requires from us some sorrow, while more than this is the result of vanity. But never will I demand of you that you should not grieve at all."
 <br>
 <br>
"We live in a world in which there is much to be angry about, meaning that unless we can learn to control our anger, we will be perpetually angry. Being angry, Seneca concludes, is a waste of precious time."
 <br>
 <br>
Seneca observes, "our anger invariably lasts longer than the damage done to us."
 <br>
 <br>
Seneca also says that laughter, and a lot of it, is the right response to the things which drive us to tears."
 <br>
 <br>
If we seek social status, we give other people power over us.
 <br>
 <br>
"We should guard against a taste for delicacies, because once we start in this direction, it will be difficult to stop."
 <br>
 <br>
Luxury harms the soul by making it undisciplined and cowardly. Luxurious living must be completely avoided.
 <br>
 <br>
"A stoic will do what she can to make herself useful to her fellow humans."
 <br>
 <br>
Sophocles on his lack of sexual desire as an old man: "I am very glad to have escaped from this, like a slave who has escaped from a mad and cruel master."
 <br>
 <br>
"It is better to die with distinction than to live long." - Cato
 <br>
 <br>
"If you have a philosophy of life, decision making is relative straightforward."
