      <h1>The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch</h1>
      <br>
<b><u>PART I</u></b>
<br><br>
"The 80/20 principle asserts that a minority of causes, inputs or effort usually lead to a majority of the results, outputs or rewards."
<br><br>
Harvard professor of philology George K. Zipf discovered 'the principle of least effort' in 1949. Resources tend to arrange themselves to minimize work, so that 20 percent of resources accounts for 80 percent of activity.
<br><br>
Joseph Moses Juran took the Pareto Principle and Rule of the Vital Few and transformed the quality control industry…. US Industrialists weren't interested in Joseph Juran's theories in the 1950s so Juran went to Japan. Its not surprise the Japanese dominated quality for the next several decades. Not until the 1970s was Juran taken seriously in the west.
<br><br>
"The 80/20 principle will always re-assert itself, unless conscious, consistent and massive efforts are made to sustain and overcome it."
<br><br>
The 50% inputs = 50% outputs fallacy is one of the most harmful and inaccurate, as well as deeply rooted, mental models.
<br><br>
Companies and people rarely apply the 80/20 principle -- because it means you have admit that 80% of what you've been doing has been a waste. This is not a small change.
<br><br>
"The last third of the twentieth century has seen a revolution in the way that scientists think about the universe, overturning the prevailing wisdom for the past 350 years. That prevailing wisdom was a machine-based and rational view, which itself was a great advance on the mystical and random view of the world which was held in the Middle Ages. The machine-based view converted God from being an irrational and unpredictable force into a more user-friendly clockmaker-engineer."
<br><br>
The 80/20 principle and chaos theory have something in common: "They both say that the world is not linear; cause and effect are rarely linked in an equal way." 
<br><br>
A few things are important; most are not.
<br><br>
For example, 80 per cent of the typical person’s happiness or achievement in life occurs in a small proportion of that life.
<br><br>
Of course, the exact relationship may not be 80/20. 80/20 is both a convenient metaphor and a useful hypothesis, but it is not the only pattern.
<br><br>
Like any simple and effective tool, 80/20 Analysis can also be misunderstood, misapplied and, instead of being the means to an unusual insight, serve as the justification for conventional thuggery.
<br><br>
For example: A book store may realize that 20% of books make up for 80% of profits. But the book store would be wrong to stock only those books. The customers who buy those 20% of books appreciate the selection even if they never use the selection. A better use of 80/20 would be to focus on what the most profitable customers want.
<br><br><br><br>
<b><u>PART III: Work Less, Earn More, Enjoy More</u></b>
<br><br>
The power of the 80/20 Principle lies in doing things differently based on unconventional wisdom.
<br><br>
You made me unhappy because you were late. My poor schooling led to my dead-end job. I have been successful because I am very clever. Hitler caused the Second World War. My firm cannot grow because the industry is declining. Unemployment is the price we pay for low inflation. High taxes are necessary if we want to look after the poor, the sick and the old. And so on. All of these are examples of linear thinking. 
<br><br>
Nothing flows from one simple cause. Nothing is inevitable. Nothing is ever in equilibrium or unchangeable. No undesired state of affairs need endure. Nothing desirable need be unobtainable.
<br><br>
But time management aims to fit a litre into a pint pot. It is about speeding up. 80/20 is not time management.
<br><br>
The 80/20 Principle treats time as a friend, not an enemy. It is our use of time, and not time itself, that is the enemy.
<br><br>
It is not shortage of time that should worry us, but the tendency for the majority of time to be spent in low-quality ways.
<br><br>
"Decide on your own patron saints of productive laziness. Mine are Ronald Reagan and Warren Buffett." <br><br>
The 80/20 Principle shows time and time again that the 20 per cent who achieve the most either work for themselves or behave as if they do.
<br><br>
Once in your profession, if making money is really important to you and if you are any good at what you do, you should aim to become self- employed as soon as possible and, after that, to start to employ others. 
<br><br>
"There are only four types of officer. First, there are the lazy, stupid ones. Leave them alone, they do no harm. . . Second, there are the hard-working intelligent ones. They make excellent staff officers, ensuring that every detail is properly considered. Third, there are the hard-working, stupid ones. These people are a menace and must be fired at once. They create irrelevant work for everybody. Finally, there are the intelligent lazy ones. They are suited for the highest office."" - General Von Manstein on the German Officer Corps
<br><br>
find the place where your name is already inscribed, where you can be intelligent, lazy and highly rewarded. The ten golden Rules:
	<ul>
		<li>Specialize in a very small niche; develop a core skill.</li>
		<li>Choose a niche that you enjoy, where you can excel and stand a chance of becoming an acknowledged leader.</li>
		<li>Realize that knowledge is power.</li>
		<li>Identify your market and your core customers and serve them best.</li>
		<li>Identify where 20 per cent of effort gives 80 per cent of returns.</li>
		<li>Learn from the best.</li>
		<li>Become self-employed early in your career.</li>
		<li>Employ as many net value creators as possible.</li>
		<li>Use outside contractors for everything but your core skill.</li>
		<li>Exploit capital leverage.</li>
	</ul>
<br>
Specialize in an area in which you are already interested and which you enjoy. You will not become an acknowledged leader in anything that cannot command your enthusiasm and passion.
<br><br>	
Aristotle said that the goal of all human activity should be happiness. Down the ages, we haven’t listened much to Aristotle.
<br><br>
Start by cutting off the ‘valleys of unhappiness’, the things that tend to make you actively unhappy. The best way to start being more happy is to stop being unhappy.
