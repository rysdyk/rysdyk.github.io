      <h1>The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs by Carmine Gallo</h1>
<br>
"Jobs is a complicated man who creates extraordinary products, cultivates intense loyalty, and also scares the shit out of people."
<br><br>
"He is a passionate perfectionist and a visionary, two qualities that create a combustible combination when the way things are do not match the way Jobs believes they should be."
<br><br>
"When you see someone who has turned his passion into a profit, as yourself, 'why not me?'" - Donny Deutsch
<br><br>
"Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected." - Steve Jobs
<br><br>
Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz does not sell coffee, he sells a "third place" between work and home.
<br><br>
Suze Orman doesn't sell mutual funds and trusts, she sells the dream of financial freedom.
<br><br>
Ask yourself, what am I really selling?
<br><br>
"Design experts, including those who create presentations for Apple, recommend that presenters spend the majority of their time thinking, sketching, and scripting."
<br><br>
Steve Jobs never uses bullet points in a presentation. Ever.
<br><br>
The Napkin Test: many great business were started on the back of a napkin. Including Southwest Airlines. Your concept should be simple enough to fit on napkin, or else you don't understand it well enough.
<br><br>
Nine Elements of Great Presentations
<ul>
	<li>Headline</li>
		<ul>
		<li>like your spoon feeding a journalist the headline you want them to use.
</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Passion Statement</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Aristotle called this Pathos.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Three Key Messages</li>
	<li>Metaphors and Analogies</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Metaphor is "the most important thing by far." - Aristotle</li>
			<li>"An analogy is a comparison between two different things in order to highlight some area of similarity. Analogies help us understand concepts that might be foreign to us."</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Demonstrations</li>
		<ul>
		<li>"Your audience wants to see, touch, and experience your product or service. Bring it to life."</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Partners</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Jobs shares the stage with key partners as well as his products</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Customer Evidence and Third Party Endorsements</li>
	<li>Video Clips</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Jobs plays video clips very often</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Flip Charts, Props, and Show-and-Tell</li>
		<ul>
		<li>"There are three types of learners: visual (the majority of people), auditory, and kinesthetic. Find ways to appeal to everyone.</li>
		<li>"Slides don't tell stories; you do."</li>
		</ul>
</ul>


<br><br>
Aristotle's classic five point plan to create a persuasive argument:
<ul>
	<li>Deliver a story or statement that arouses the audiences interest.</li>
	<li>Pose a problem or question that has to be solved or answered.</li>
	<li>Offer a solution to the problem you raised.</li>
	<li>Describe specific benefits for adopting the course of action set forth in your solution.</li>
	<li>State a call to action. For steve, its as simple as saying, "Now go out and buy one!"</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Your audience is always asking: why should I care?
<br><br>
"During the planning phase of your presentation, always remember that it's not about you. It's about them. The listeners in your audience are asking themselves one question -- "Why should I care?" Answer that one question right out of the gate will grab people's attention and keep them engaged."
<br><br>
"Your audience doesn't care about your product. People care about themselves."
<br><br>
"The essence of evangelism is to passionately show people how your can make history together." - Guy Kawasaki
<br><br>
"[Steve Jobs] uses your first name very often. He looks directly in your eyes with that laser-like stare. He has these movie star eyes that are very hypnotic. But what really gets you is the way he talk -- There's something about the rhythm of his speech and the incredible enthusiasm he conveys for whatever it is he's talking about that is just infectious." Alan Deutschman on meeting Jobs in person
<br><br>
"Find something you love to do so much, you can't wait for the sun to rise to do it all over again." Chris Gardner (Persuit of Happiness)
<br><br>
"I was worth over a million dollars when I was twenty-three, and over ten million dollars when I was twenty-four, and over a hundred million when I was twenty-five, and it wasn't that important, because I never did it for the money." - Steve Jobs
<br><br>
"going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters to me." - Steve Jobs
<br><br>
"if you don't have passion, you have no energy, and if you don't have energy, you have nothing." - Donald Trump
<br><br>
"Music is really being reinvented in this digital age, and that is bringing it back into people's lives. It's a wonderful thing. And in our own small way, that's how we're going to make the world a better place." - Jobs on the iPod (its not just about sales, its about making the world a better place)
<br><br>
"Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don't take the time to do that." - Steve Jobs
<br><br>
Grok: understand (something intuitively or by empathy)
<br><br>
"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been." - Wayne Gretzky (a fav quote of steve jobs)
<br><br>
Create Twitter like headlines. Jobs has a one-line description for nearly every product. The headline is consistent. Examples: Today Apple Reinvents the Phone, One Thousand Songs in Your Pocket
<br><br>
Roadmap: the Rule of Three
<br><br>
"Three is the magic number. Comedians know that three is funnier than two. Writers know that three is more dramatic than four. Jobs knows that three is more persuasive than five. Every great movie, book, play, or presentation has a three-act structure. There were three musketeers, not five. Goldilocks encountered three bears, not four. There were three stooges, not two. Legendary NFL coach Vince Lombardi told his players there are three important things in life: family, religion, and Green Bay Packers. And the US Declaration of Independence states that Americans have a right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
<br><br>
The US Marine Corp has actually studied this subject scientifically and found three is best. For both organization and giving orders, do it in threes.
<br><br>
"There are no agenda slides in a Steve Jobs presentation, just verbal road maps."
<br><br>
Jimmy Valvano's famous speech: "To me, there are three things we all should do everyday. We should do this every day of our lives. Number one is laugh. You should laugh every day. Number two is think. You should spend some time in thought. And number three is, you should have your emotions moved to tears -- could be happiness or joy. But think about it. If you laugh, you think, and you cry, that's a full dayâ€¦ Cancer can take away all my physical ability. It cannot touch my mind; it cannot touch my heart; and it cannot touch my soul. And those three things are going to carry on forever. I thank you and God bless all of you."
<br><br>
Establish an Antagonist. This helps set up the problem you are going to solve. Establishing an antagonist is critical to persuasion.
<br><br>
"Your brain craves meaning before details." 
<br><br>
The ultimate elevator pitch answers these four questions: (1) what do you do? (2) what problem do you solve? (3) How are you different? (4) Why should I care?
<br><br>
The antagonist is a convenient story telling tool.
<br><br>
You are the conquering hero in the story.
<br><br>
"The hero's mission in a Steve Jobs presentation is not necessarily to slay the bad guy, but to make our lives better."
<br><br>
The Ten Minute Rule: The brain gets bored after 10 minutes. Change it up every 10 minutes. Talk about something new, get a guest speaker, show a video, just do something different.
<br><br>
"A Steve Jobs presentation is strikingly simple, visual, and devoid of bullet points. That's right -- no bullet points. Ever."
<br><br>
You never heard Jobs use meaningless jargon like "synergy," "principle-centered," or "best of breed."
<br><br>
"Insecure managers create complexity." - Jack Welch
<br><br>
"don't sell solutions; create stories instead."
<br><br>
Word of mouth: never forget your customers are your sales force
<br><br>
Have fun with demos. Steve Jobs crank called Starbucks when he introduced the iPhone and ordered 4000 lattes to go.
<br><br>
"People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." - Maya Angelou
<br><br>
Reveal a Holy Shit moment. Pulling the iPod Nano out of the small jeans pocket. Pulling Macbook Air out of an manilla envelop. 
<br><br>
Steve Jobs makes eye contact, maintains an open posture, and uses frequent hand gestures (more than normal). Jobs has some notes on side stage he can glance at quickly, but he practices so much he really doesn't need notes.
<br><br>
Don't use a monotone voice. Use inflection. Speak high, loud, fast, low, soft, slow. Use well placed pauses.
<br><br>
Steve Jobs is not a "natural." Nobody is a "natural." Successful people use deliberate practice.
<br><br>
When practicing, consciously bring up your energy level. Ham it up. Raise your voice. Use broad gestures. Put a big smile on your face. If you feel just a little over the top, you're doing it right. That's where you want to be.
<br><br>
Practice everything. Steve Jobs even carefully scripted the starbucks crank call routine, though it appeared spontaneous and fun.
<br><br>
The "bucket  method" to answering questions. Henry Kissinger said, "what questions do you have for my answers?" Come up with likely questions to be asked. Categorize them into "buckets." Come up with a really great answer for each bucket. Use the corresponding bucket answer for any question that comes up. Politicians do this all the time, but usually poorly. This can be done well.
<br><br>
The bottom line is to always have fun. Have Fun!
<br><br>
"I have no secret. There are no rules to follow in business. I just work hard and, as I always have done, believe I can do it. Most of all, though, I try to have fun." - Richard Branson
