&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#aliases&quot;&gt;Aliases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#quick-jump&quot;&gt;Quick Jump Between Folders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#display-git-branch&quot;&gt;Display Current Git Branch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#git-tab-completion&quot;&gt;Add Git Branch Completion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these things involve downloading some stuff and then updating the .bash_profile or .bashrc. To open those, in terminal type: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;open ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;open ~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aliases&quot;&gt;Aliases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aliases are shortcuts for things commonly typed into terminal: instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rails console&lt;/code&gt;, just use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rc&lt;/code&gt; and instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;, just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gpom&lt;/code&gt;. It’s nice to avoid typing the same things over and over again, especially if it’s easy to make a typo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gdm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;olm&lt;/code&gt; are two of my particular favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Homebrew needed here. Just setup aliases like these in .bashrc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;alias m=&quot;mate .&quot;
alias o=&quot;open .&quot;
alias s=&quot;sublime .&quot;
alias a=&quot;atom .&quot;

  # git aliases
alias gl=&quot;git pull&quot;
alias gc=&quot;git checkout&quot;
alias gp=&quot;git push&quot;
alias gpom=&quot;git push origin master&quot;
alias gb=&quot;git branch&quot;
alias gs=&quot;git status&quot;
alias gaa=&quot;git add .&quot;
alias gr=&quot;git rebase&quot;
alias grc=&quot;git rebase --continue&quot;
alias gri=&quot;git rebase -i&quot;
alias gcm=&quot;git commit -m&quot;
alias gd=&quot;git diff&quot;
 # open all files with git conflicts in textmate
alias gdm=&quot;git diff --name-only | uniq | xargs mate&quot;
alias glg=&quot;git log&quot;


  # rails related aliases
alias rc=&quot;rails console&quot;
alias rs=&quot;rails server&quot;
alias rdbm=&quot;rake db:migrate&quot;
alias rdbs=&quot;rake db:seed&quot;
alias renvt=&quot;RAILS_ENV=test&quot;
alias rt=&quot;rake test&quot;
alias be=&quot;bundle exec&quot;
alias bi=&quot;bundle install&quot;
alias bu=&quot;bundle update&quot;
 # open last migration in textmate
alias olm=&quot;ls db/migrate/* | tail -n1 | xargs mate&quot;

alias js=&quot;jekyll serve&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure .bashrc is referenced in .bash_profile. At or near the top of .bash_profile include this line: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source ~/.bashrc  # get my Bash aliases&lt;/code&gt;. Also, .bashrc is really picky about formatting, the alias needs to touch the equals sign which needs to touch the opening double quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is updated, start a new terminal session or use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source ~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; in the current session to make the new aliases available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quick-jump&quot;&gt;Quick Jump&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick jump between folders is a game-changer. From within one app, navigate directly to another non-linear folder or even another app without changing directory up and down multiple levels!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; to install bash completion: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install bash-completion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following code to .bash_profile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then
. $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
fi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in .bashrc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;PROJ_DIR=&quot;~/Work&quot;
ORDERED_SUBFOLDERS=&quot;app1 app2 app3 app4 app5&quot;

CDPATH=&quot;.:~:$PROJ_DIR&quot;
for FOLDER in $ORDERED_SUBFOLDERS; do
  CDPATH=&quot;$CDPATH:$PROJ_DIR/$FOLDER&quot;
done&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, PROJ_DIR will be the main folder (it could be anything). Then specify the subfolders, whatever those are. Restart terminal, and cd between app projects without navigating up and down directories one at a time. Folders within the sub folders will be available to quick jump to as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;display-git-branch&quot;&gt;Display Git Branch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to see which branch we’re working on. To display the current git branch in terminal, place this code in .bash_profile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;parse_git_branch() {
     git branch 2&amp;gt; /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
export PS1=&quot;\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ &quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;git-tab-completion&quot;&gt;Git Tab Completion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like terminal will try to auto-compelete folder and file names with tab, we can add the same thing for git branch names. Just type the first few letters of a branch name and tab to complete it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install git-completion via curl command: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add the following to .bashrc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;if [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then
  . ~/.git-completion.bash

  # Add git completion to aliases
  __git_complete gc _git_checkout
  __git_complete gl _git_pull
  __git_complete gp _git_push
  __git_complete gb _git_branch
fi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restart terminal or re-source the .bash_profile. Not only does this work with regular typed out git commands, but it will work with aliases as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="code" /><summary type="html">Here are a few quick things to make working in Mac’s Terminal with Rails and Git a little better: Aliases Quick Jump Between Folders Display Current Git Branch Add Git Branch Completion</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Simple Responsive SCSS Grid</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/20/simple-scss-responsive-grid.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Simple Responsive SCSS Grid" /><published>2018-01-20T06:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-01-20T06:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/01/20/simple-scss-responsive-grid</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/20/simple-scss-responsive-grid.html">&lt;p&gt;CSS grids are great, but a whole framework (Bootstrap, Foundation, etc) for a simple grid is unnecessary – many mbs and thousands of lines of code for a little organization and responsiveness?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple grid I’ve been using in a few lines of scss:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scss&quot; data-lang=&quot;scss&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// grid.scss
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;clearfix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;both&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;90%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;clearfix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.row&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;clearfix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;screen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;700px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is how it’s used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- page.html --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;container&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;row&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;className&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;className&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;className&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scss&quot; data-lang=&quot;scss&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// stylesheet.scss (with grid imported)
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done. Mobile-first, responsive columns. Above 700px (or whatever is specified) div.className becomes 3 columns and below it’s one column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sidenote: keeping up with different device widths and pixel densities isn’t sustainable. I’ve found it’s fine to set one or two breakpoints where the structure of the page can dramatically change; meanwhile, the content is always responsive within those breakpoints. Everything is responsive, yet simple and device agnostic. More on this idea: &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsilver.io/articles/stop-using-device-breakpoints/&quot;&gt;Stop Using Device Breakpoints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s trivial to set up multiple breakpoints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scss&quot; data-lang=&quot;scss&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$screen-md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;900px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$screen-lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1200px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;screen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$screen-md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;screen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$screen-lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this simple, it’s also semantic! No need to bloat the html with column classes: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;className col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3 col-lg-2&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Both of these have served as my introduction to urbanism and city planning. In addition to city planning this book is more broadly about human happiness and economics. In the United States, “economic growth” is dogma. Many believe the end of economic growth justify the means. But what is the point of economic growth if people generally unhappier and unhealthier? What if short-term econonomic growth in a quarter-by-quarter economy comes at the expense of long-term economic growth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dream of riches, Peñalosa complained, served only to make Bogotans feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peñalosa promised neither a car in every garage nor a socialist revolution. His promise was simple. He was going to make Bogotans happier. “And what are our needs for happiness?” he asked. “We need to walk, just as birds need to fly. We need to be around other people. We need beauty. We need contact with nature. And most of all, we need not to be excluded. We need to feel some sort of equality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a gospel of transformative urbanism. The city itself could be a device for happiness. Life could be improved, even amid economic doldrums, by changing the shapes and systems that defined urban existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peñalosa’s first and most defining act as mayor was to declare war: not on crime or drugs or poverty, but on private cars. “A city can be friendly to people or it can be friendly to cars, but it can’t be both,” he announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third year of his term Peñalosa challenged Bogotans to participate in an experiment, a día sin carro. As of dawn on February 24, 2000, all private cars were banned from city streets for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first day in four years that nobody was killed in traffic. Hospital admissions fell by almost a third. The toxic haze over the city thinned. People still got to work, and schools reported normal attendance. Bogotans enjoyed the day so much that they voted to make it a yearly affair, and to ban all private cars during rush hour every day by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The urban shake-up that began with the mortgage crisis in 2008 hit the newest, shiniest, most sprawling parts of the American city the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sprawl city requires cheap energy, cheap land, and cheap materials, and the days of cheap are over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man could achieve pure happiness only by reaching the height of his potential, and that meant not just thinking virtuously but behaving virtuously too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith warned that it was a deception to believe that wealth and comfort alone would bring happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He found that people who claimed to be happy tended to have more blood flowing to that left prefrontal region than to the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the ways they passed their days, having sex made the women happiest of all, with socializing coming a close second. What made them least happy? Commuting to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside Disneyland, even today, every architectural detail, every view, every transportation experience, every sensation—right down to the texture of the pavement and the scent of the air—was designed with the express purpose of tipping the hedonic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are left with the question of authenticity: If you’re happy, does reality matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are well educated rate their happiness higher than those who aren’t. Employed people are happier than unemployed people—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life satisfaction is strongly influenced by location.* People in small towns are generally happier than people who live in big cities. People who live next to the ocean report being happier than those who don’t. Living under the flight path of commuter jets is terrible for happiness. Persistent wind is bad, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when it comes to life satisfaction, relationships with other people beat income, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just going from being friendless to having one friend or family member to confide in had the same effect on life satisfaction as a tripling of income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our trust in neighbors, police, governments, and even total strangers has a huge influence on happiness—again, much more than income does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cities must be regarded as more than engines of wealth; they must be viewed as systems that should be shaped to improve human well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every new urban plaza, starchitect-designed tower, or sleek new light-rail network, there are a hundred thousand cul-de-sacs out in the dispersed city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the dispersed city is the most expensive, resource-intense, land-gobbling, polluting way of living ever built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average exurban family needs at least one more car than do families who live close to where they work, shop, study, and play. That family also spends twice as much just getting around in order to meet its daily needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It’s also a reason that the farther a house was from a vibrant city center, the more likely it was to experience foreclosure during the crash,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in a detached home on the urban edge is like gambling on oil futures and global geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as we complain about other people, there is nothing worse for mental health than a social desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cities. A Swedish study found that people who endure more than a forty-five-minute commute were 40 percent more likely to divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People’s new homes were so big that they created a whole new layer of housekeeping, and so expensive that they forced their owners to work harder to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans do not perceive the value of things in absolute terms. We never have. Just as our eyes process the color and luminosity of an object relative to its surroundings, the brain constantly adjusts its idea of what we need in order to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been hardwired for active dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Stutzer and Frey found that a person with a one-hour commute has to earn 40 percent more money to be as satisfied with life as someone who walks to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick: Which would make you happier—living in California or the U.S. Midwest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Californians and midwesterners report pretty much the same level of life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest danger is, by its nature, the least exciting. It is the sickness that comes from doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aside from sedentary Saudi Arabians and some South Pacific Islanders, Americans are now the fattest people on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;killer drivers are so common in sprawl that the carnage they create far exceeds the damage done by killers who use other weapons. In fact, someone who walks out her door on the edges of sprawl suburbia is much more likely to die at the hands of a stranger than someone moving through most American central cities or inner suburbs. The only difference is that most of suburbia’s killers didn’t mean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an image that sticks: imagine a loaded Boeing 747 crashing every three days, killing everyone aboard. That’s how many people die on U.S. highways every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rational actor would be terrified of suburban roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result: drivers kill four times as many pedestrians on spacious suburban residential streets than on the narrow streets of traditional neighborhoods, because those spacious roads make driving faster feel safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not collisions that kill people, but collisions at high speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pedestrian hit by a car going 35 miles per hour is ten times as likely to die than if he was hit by a car going 25 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average time it takes for new urban highway capacity to fill up with new demand? Five to six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using so much of the earth’s raw material that we are dooming future generations to poverty and hardship. It would take nine planets to supply all we needed if everyone ate, built, traveled, and threw stuff away as Americans do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, suburbanites pump out about twice the greenhouse gas emissions of people living in dense city centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;people who live in areas with more parks are more helpful and trusting than people who don’t, regardless of their income or race. Nature is not merely good for us. It brings out the good in us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is crucial for healthy living, she insists, is not quantity, but regular exposure, daily doses of nature. So the trick is in finding ways to infuse nature, and nature complexity, into denser places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That made Vancouver the only major city in North America without a single highway running through its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of what made Vancouver’s vertical experiment both unique and desirable was the way it accommodated residents’ biophilic needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big park won’t do. “We can’t just build Central Park and say, ‘Well, we’re done,’” Kuo insisted. “Nature has to be part of your life. It has to be part of your daily habitat and routine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search hard enough for places that balance our competing needs for privacy, nature, conviviality, and convenience, you end up with a hybrid, somewhere between the vertical and horizontal city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Second World War, the capital of Denmark had embraced dispersal as fervently as any American city. Everyone bought a car, and suburbs spilled out from the city’s medieval heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found that if you make more road space, you get more cars. If you make more bike lanes, you get more bikes. If you make more space for people, you get more people and of course then you get public life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, the word community is increasingly used to refer to groups of people who use the same media or who happen to like a certain product, regardless of whether its members have actually met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Television, that great window to the world, has been an unequivocal disaster for happiness. The more TV you watch, the fewer friendships you are likely to have, the less trusting you become, and the less happy you are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;every urban landscape is a collection of memory- and emotion-activating symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human bones have evolved to withstand impact with hard surfaces up to a speed of about twenty miles per hour, which is faster than a reasonably fit person can run.* So it is natural to get anxious when confronted with hard objects moving faster than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants begin to ask what streets are for, and they invariably seize upon the answer that Copenhageners found decades ago: streets are for whatever we decide they are for, and central cities need not accept the discomforts thrust on them by dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder four in ten Americans actually claim to love their cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One group of commuters reports enjoying themselves more than everyone else. Their route to happy mobility is simple. These are people who travel on their own steam like Robert Judge. They walk. They run. They ride bicycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would traveling more slowly and using more effort offer more satisfaction than driving? Part of the answer exists in basic human physiology. We were born to move—not merely to be transported,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The psychologist has devoted his life to the study of human moods. In test after test he proved that the most powerful way to fix a dark mood is simply to take a brisk walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can literally walk ourselves into a state of well-being. The same is true of cycling,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bicycle can expand the self-propelled travelers’ geographical reach by an astounding nine or sixteen times. Quite simply, a human on a bicycle is the most efficient traveler among all machines and animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few places design travel behavior as powerfully as Atlanta. The average working adult in Atlanta’s suburbs now drives forty-four miles a day.† Ninety-four percent of Atlantans commute by car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveys in the United States and Canada reveal that transit riders are the most miserable commuters of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that decades of underinvestment mean that the typical transit journey is crowded, slow, uncertain, or uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;administrators typically choose the most utilitarian-looking materials for bus interiors and stations—even when attractive finishes are no more expensive—simply to avoid the appearance of having wasted money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Geller and his colleagues set out to create a network of “low-stress” bikeways that either physically separated cyclists from cars or slowed cars down past the speed of fear on shared routes. It worked. Commuting by bike more than doubled in Portland between 2000 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where equity and efficiency collide: because of their light footprint, infrastructure for walkers and cyclists costs only a tiny fraction of auto infrastructure to build and maintain. So cyclists and pedestrian commuters who pay property and income tax actually end up subsidizing their car-driving neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fair city, people who share space on transit enjoy the right-of-way on congested roads. In the fair city, streets are safe for everyone, especially children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fair city, everyone has access to parks, shops, services, and healthy food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The happy city plan is an energy plan. It is a climate plan. It is a belt-tightening plan for cash-strapped cities. It is also an economic plan, a jobs plan, and a corrective for weak systems. It is a plan for resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that the power that shapes our city is in the code, not in the people. Miami looks the way it does, and Savannah the way it does, Paris the way it does, and New York City the way it does, and San Francisco the way it does, because of codes,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;change the code and you change the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Urbanists were determined to undo the modernists’ work. They wrote a manifesto calling for compact, mixed-use, mixed-income neighborhoods of walkable street networks, with transit and attractive public spaces, all framed by buildings that responded to the local culture and climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest problem facing anyone who would repair sprawl remains the godlike power of code. Code is to the city what an operating system is to a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the battle for American cities has moved from architectural drafting tables to the dense, arcane pages of the zoning codebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than totally replacing the county’s old code, it now runs alongside it: property developers can choose which code they wish to have applied to their project applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the imposition of the grid or any other plan from on high has another, ultimately more profound effect on the people who must inhabit it: it estranges them from the process of shaping their own world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that great irony of the American city: a nation that celebrates freedom and weaves liberty into its national myth rarely gives regular people the chance to shape their own communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scant few neighborhoods in North America feature places that draw people together regularly for anything other than buying stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nobody had fathomed just how deadly it was to be friendless. “We found, if you’re socially isolated, your risk for heat wave mortality goes up sevenfold,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made mistakes. We have been seduced by the wrong technologies. We gave up true freedom for the illusory promise of speed. We valued status over relationships. We tried to stamp out complexity instead of harnessing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We let the fear of being uncomfortable, inconvenienced, or hurt guide us into cities that not only isolate us but rob us of all the ease and pleasure and richness we might enjoy if the city were just a little bit more layered, a little bit more complex, a little bit messier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It dawned on Schmidt that the less money he made, the better his life was becoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They realize that the happy city, the low carbon city, and the city that will save us are the same place, and that they have the wherewithal to create it. This is the truth that shines over the journey toward the happy city. We do not need to wait for someone else to make it. We build it when we choose how and where to live. We build it when we move a little bit closer. We build it when we choose to move a little slower. We build it by choosing to put aside our fear of the city and other people. We build the happy city by pursuing it in our own lives and, in so doing, pushing the city to change with us. We build it by living it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Montgomery</name></author><summary type="html">I read this book just after reading Walkable City.

I enjoyed this book so much that immediately wanted to read more about city planning – thus, Happy City. Compared to Happy City, this book really makes the economic case for good urban planning. For better or worse this book comes across as anti-automobile. This will turn-off people who are very attached to their cars. However, for those open minded enough to see a better – or at least different way – car ownership is really self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is not about why cities work or how cities work, but about what works in cities. And what works best in the best cities is walkability. Walkability is both an end and a means, as well as a measure. While the physical and social rewards of walking are many, walkability is perhaps most useful as it contributes to urban vitality and most meaningful as an indicator of that vitality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get walkability right and so much of the rest will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whether intentionally or by accident, most American cities have effectively become no-walking zones. In the absence of any larger vision or mandate, city engineers—worshiping the twin gods of Smooth Traffic and Ample Parking—have turned our downtowns into places that are easy to get to but not worth arriving at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing that makes Rome—and the other winners: Venice, Boston, San Francisco, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Prague, Paris, and New York—so walkable is what we planners call “fabric,” the everyday collection of streets, blocks, and buildings that tie the monuments together. Despite its many technical failures, Rome’s fabric is superb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there is more to walking than just making safe, pretty space for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The General Theory of Walkability explains how, to be favored, a walk has to satisfy four main conditions: it must be useful, safe, comfortable, and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 85 percent of money expended on cars and gas leaves the local economy22—much of it, of course, bound for the pockets of Middle Eastern princes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While transportation used to absorb only one-tenth of a typical family’s budget (1960), it now consumes more than one in five dollars spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly affected have been our children. While fully 50 percent walked to school in 1969, fewer than 15 percent do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1970s, only about one in ten Americans was obese, which put us where much of Europe is right now. What has happened in the intervening thirty years is astonishing: by 2007, that rate had risen to one in three,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As recently as 1991, no states had adult obesity rates over 20 percent. By 2007, only one state, Colorado, was under 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excessive weight now kills more Americans than smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car crashes have killed over 3.2 million Americans, considerably more than all of our wars combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States in 2004 suffered 14.5 traffic fatalities per 100,000 population, Germany, with its no-speed-limit autobahns, suffered only 7.1. Denmark rated a 6.8, Japan a 5.8, and the U.K. hit 5.3.27 And who beat them all? New York City, with a rate of 3.1. Indeed, since September 11, 2001, New York has saved more lives in traffic than it lost on 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our entire country shared New York City’s traffic statistics, we would prevent more than twenty-four thousand deaths a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic theory held true: car crashes far outweighed murder by strangers as a cause of death in all locations and, in older cities like Pittsburgh, the inner cities were considerably safer overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, a Miami study found that “after driving their cars across the city for forty-five minutes, university students had higher blood pressure, higher heart rates, and lower frustration tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, people with longer commutes report “lower satisfaction with life” than those who drive less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the most green home (with Prius) in sprawl still loses out to the least green home in a walkable neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“LEED architecture without good urban design is like cutting down the rainforest using hybrid-powered bulldozers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;economist Ed Glaeser, who puts it this way: “We are a destructive species, and if you love nature, stay away from it. The best means of protecting the environment is to live in the heart of a city.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, New York consumes half the gasoline of Atlanta (326 versus 782 gallons per person per year). But Toronto cuts that number in half again, as does Sydney—and most European cities use only half as much as those places. Cut Europe’s number in half and you end up with Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gold standard of quality-of-life rankings is the Mercer Survey, which carefully compares global cities in the ten categories of political stability, economics, social quality, health and sanitation, education, public services, recreation, consumer goods, housing, and climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest-rated American cities in 2010, which don’t appear until number 31, are Honolulu, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Washington, New York, and Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington, D.C., is one of a handful of American cities that can accurately be described as car-optional. New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and not many others, provide an equivalent or better quality of life for the carless,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewis Mumford declared that “our national flower is the concrete cloverleaf,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;induced demand is the great intellectual black hole in city planning,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic studies are bullshit. They are bullshit for three main reasons: First: The computer model is only as good as its inputs, and there’s nothing easier than tweaking the inputs to get the outcome you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: Traffic studies are typically performed by firms that do traffic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;guess who gets the big contract for the roadway expansion that the study deems necessary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, and most essentially: The main problem with traffic studies is that they almost never consider the phenomenon of induced demand. Induced demand is the name for what happens when increasing the supply of roadways lowers the time cost of driving, causing more people to drive and obliterating any reductions in congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metro area with the highest estimated road building cost was Nashville, Tennessee with a price tag of $3,243 per family per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;congestion actually saves fuel—and ultimately is one of the only things that does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody likes Jane Jacobs, right? She was famous for fighting traffic engineers, and took them to task repeatedly and effectively in her masterpiece, The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Most planners and many public servants swear by that book, but few have read Dark Age Ahead, in which, forty years later, she took off the gloves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond giving new life to the areas previously blighted by the highways, these road removals have actually been found to reduce overall travel times within their cities. The most celebrated, and properly so, has got to be the Cheonggyecheon (pronounced chung-yay-chun) Freeway in Seoul, where a traffic-choked elevated expressway was hauled down in the mid-2000s, daylighting the river that it had obscured for half a century.25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would seem that only one thing is more destructive to the health of our downtowns than welcoming cars unconditionally and that is getting rid of them entirely. The proper response to obesity is not to stop eating, and most stores need car traffic to survive. With autos reintroduced, most failed pedestrian malls, like Monroe Place in Grand Rapids, have come back at least partway. The key is to welcome cars in the proper number and at the proper speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayor Ken Livingstone proposed the only known cure, economics. Against “a massive and sustained media campaign,”36 he introduced a roughly fifteen-dollar fee for any driver who wanted to enter the congested heart of the city on weekdays, with the revenue to be used to support a progressive transportation agenda. Here’s what happened: Congestion dropped 30 percent in the toll zone, and typical journey times went down by 14 percent. Cycling among Londoners jumped 20 percent and air pollution fell about 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan Illich, the multinational intellectual who in 1973 wrote the smartest thing that I have yet to read about transportation: “Beyond a certain speed, motorized vehicles create remoteness which they alone can shrink. They create distances for all and shrink them for only a few.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is remarkable. Compared to our colonial ancestors, we throw 25 percent more of our national and personal resources into transportation and we ultimately move no faster. But we do move farther,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illich discovered a hidden physical law: the faster a society moves, the more it spreads out and the more time it must spend moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking covers more acres of urban America than any other one thing3—just look at an aerial photo of downtown Houston—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than parking working in the service of cities, cities have been working in the service of parking, almost entirely to their detriment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to understanding how parking works is to get a grasp of how much it costs and who pays for it. Because it is so plentiful and often free to use, it is easy to imagine that it costs very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheapest urban parking space in America, an 8½-by-18-foot piece of asphalt on relatively worthless land, costs about four thousand dollars to create—and not much urban land is worthless. The most expensive parking space, in an underground parking garage, can cost forty thousand dollars or more to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between those extremes is the standard aboveground urban parking structure, which can usually be built for between twenty and thirty thousand dollars per space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the first nationwide count determined that there are half a billion empty parking spaces in America at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When parking is no longer the exclusive property of an individual business, it becomes much more efficient. A space that serves an office during the day can serve a restaurant in the evening and a resident overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, Americans require parking and limit density, while Europeans require density and limit parking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With rare exceptions, every transit trip begins and ends with a walk. As a result, while walkability benefits from good transit, good transit relies absolutely on walkability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly a third of Washingtonians and San Franciscans take transit to work, and the majority of New Yorkers do. Perennial sprawl stars like Jacksonville and Nashville, on the other hand, hover below 2 percent, no matter how you measure them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to America’s Finest News Source, The Onion, “98 percent of U.S. commuters favor public transportation for others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He determined that each resident of the seven high-quality cities paid roughly $370 more per year for public transportation than a resident of the other forty-three, but saved $1,040 in vehicle, parking, and road costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true neighborhood has a center and an edge, and contains a wide variety of activities in close proximity within an armature of pedestrian-friendly streets and public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to reduce traffic is to reduce roads or to increase the cost of using them, and that is a bitter pill that few pro-transit cities are ready to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And without true walkability on both ends of the line, your system is a nonstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your goals are efficiency and pleasure, rail beats bus hands down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that only 5 percent of pedestrian collisions at twenty miles per hour result in death, versus 85 percent at forty mph,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a sidewalk safe is not its width, but whether it is protected by a line of parked cars that form a barrier of steel between the pedestrian and the roadway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way that cities increase traffic flow at the expense of pedestrians is with the “right on red” rule. God knows, I love this as a driver, but, as Jan Gehl puts it, “the widespread American practice of allowing cars to ‘turn right on red’ at intersections is unthinkable in cities that want to invite people to walk and bicycle.”27 It is banned in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cycling has got to be the most efficient, healthful, empowering, and sustainable form of transportation there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, and supposedly part of America, the most bike friendly of our sizeable cities has got to be Portland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedaling Revolution—the seminal book on urban cycling—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the regular cyclists were as fit as the noncyclists ten years younger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an ecological perspective, then, most U.S. cities offer too much grassland and too little forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the design right and people will walk in almost any climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;following your passion is not particularly useful advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, you need to be good at something before you can expect a good job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“do what you love, and the money will follow” has become the de facto motto of the career-advice field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Follow your passion” might just be terrible advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s hard to predict in advance what you’ll eventually grow to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These interviews emphasize an important point: Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2010 Conference Board survey of U.S. job satisfaction found that only 45 percent of Americans describe themselves as satisfied with their jobs. This number has been steadily decreasing from the mark of 61 percent recorded in 1987, the first year of the survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling someone to “follow their passion” is not just an act of innocent optimism, but potentially the foundation for a career riddled with confusion and angst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for most people, “follow your passion” is bad advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired, I turned my attention from my website to a habit that continues to this day: I track the hours spent each month dedicated to thinking hard about research problems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll call this output-centric approach to work the craftsman mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of what type of work you do, the craftsman mindset is crucial for building a career you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer the world, the passion mindset focuses instead on what the world can offer you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the deep questions driving the passion mindset—“Who am I?” and “What do I truly love?”—are essentially impossible to confirm. “Is this who I really am?” and “Do I love this?” rarely reduce to clear yes-or-no responses. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to keep you perpetually unhappy and confused,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the craftsman mindset: It asks you to leave behind self-centered concerns about whether your job is “just right,” and instead put your head down and plug away at getting really damn good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am suggesting that you put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can’t ignore you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mark Casstevens put it, “the tape doesn’t lie”: If you’re a guitar player or a comedian, what you produce is basically all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you’ll build a compelling career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life, and the craftsman mindset is focused on achieving exactly this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THREE DISQUALIFIERS FOR APPLYING THE CRAFTSMAN MINDSET The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable. The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world. The job forces you to work with people you really dislike. A job with any combination of these disqualifying traits can thwart your attempts to build and invest career capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex and Mike both focused on getting good—not finding their passion—and then used the career capital this generated to acquire the traits that made their careers compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it. As you’ll learn more about in the next chapter, Mike literally tracks every hour of his day, down to quarter-hour increments, on a spreadsheet. He wants to ensure that his attention is focused on the activities that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that the players who became grand masters spent five times more hours dedicated to serious study than those who plateaued at an intermediate level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When experts exhibit their superior performance in public their behavior looks so effortless and natural that we are tempted to attribute it to special talents,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a lifetime accumulation of deliberate practice that again and again ends up explaining excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put another way, if you just show up and work hard, you’ll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in most types of work—that is, work that doesn’t have a clear training philosophy—most people are stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of deliberate practice at work. “I want to spend time on what’s important, instead of what’s immediate,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a winner-take-all market, this is trivial: By definition, there’s only one type of capital that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice requires good goals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing past what’s comfortable, however, is only one part of the deliberate-practice story; the other part is embracing honest feedback—even&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You may think that your rehearsal of a job interview was flawless, but your opinion isn’t what counts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, like many people who end up loving what they do, he stumbled into his profession, and then found that his passion for the work increased along with his expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to get good before you can expect good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derek thought for a moment. “I have this principle about money that overrides my other life rules,” he said. “Do what people are willing to pay for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derek made it clear that this is different from pursuing money for the sake of having money. Remember, this is someone who gave away $22 million and sold his possessions after his company was acquired. Instead, as he explained: “Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you’re aiming to be valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Derek explained to me, he started by pursuing music at night and on the weekend. “I didn’t quit my day job until I was making more money with my music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have a mission is to have a unifying focus for your career. It’s more general than a specific job and can span multiple positions. It provides an answer to the question, What should I do with my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it too requires that you first build career capital—a mission launched without this expertise is likely doomed to sputter and die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardness scares off the daydreamers and the timid, leaving more opportunity for those like us who are willing to take the time to carefully work out the best path forward and then confidently take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough—it’s an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field. If you want to identify a mission for your working life, therefore, you must first get to the cutting edge—the only place where these missions become visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If life-transforming missions could be found with just a little navel-gazing and an optimistic attitude, changing the world would be commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a mission, you need to first acquire capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #4 is entitled “Think Small, Act Big.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancing to the cutting edge in a field is an act of “small” thinking, requiring you to focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a potentially long time. Once you get to the cutting edge, however, and discover a mission in the adjacent possible, you must go after it with zeal: a “big” action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giles Bowkett loves what he does for a living. In fact, my first encounter with Giles was an e-mail he sent me with the subject line: “My remarkable life.” Giles, however, didn’t always love his career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turning point came in 2008 when Giles became a rock star in the community of computer programmers who specialize in a language called Ruby. “It seems as if every Ruby programmer on the planet knows my name,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He decided to take a job with ENTP, one of the country’s top Ruby programming firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A career untamed, he realized, can bring you into dangerous territory, such as being bored while writing computer code for an investment bank. He needed a mission to actively guide his career or he would end up trapped again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a name for yourself in software development—the type of name that can help you secure employment—focus your attention on making quality contributions to open-source projects. This is where the people who matter look for talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core idea of this book is simple: To construct work you love, you must first build career capital by mastering rare and valuable skills, and then cash in this capital for the type of traits that define compelling careers. Mission is one of those traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By definition, if it’s rare and valuable, it’s not easy to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I discovered, musicians, athletes, and chess players, among others, know all about deliberate practice, but knowledge workers do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another deliberate-practice routine was the introduction of my hour tally—a sheet of paper I mounted behind my desk at MIT, and plan on remounting at Georgetown. The sheet has a row for each month on which I keep a tally of the total number of hours I’ve spent that month in a state of deliberate practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working right trumps finding the right work. He didn’t need to have a perfect job to find occupational happiness—he needed instead a better approach to the work already available to him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cal Newport</name></author><summary type="html">The title comes from a Steve Martin quote.

&lt;p&gt;You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you’re satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you’ve got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug. Then you’re trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A lot of young people try to impress the world and buy too many things,” the doorman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doorman leaned into my shoulder and said, “A lot of young people don’t know what they really want.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t know what you want,” the doorman said, “you end up with a lot you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first rule about fight club is you don’t talk about fight club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t want to die without a few scars, I say. It’s nothing anymore to have a beautiful stock body. You see those cars that are completely stock cherry, right out of a dealer’s showroom in 1955, I always think, what a waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second rule about fight club is you don’t talk about fight club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the third rule in fight club, when someone says stop, or goes limp, even if he’s just faking it, the fight is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only two guys to a fight. One fight at a time. They fight without shirts or shoes. The fights go on as long as they have to. Those are the other rules of fight club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a night in fight club, everything in the real world gets the volume turned down. Nothing can piss you off. Your word is law, and if other people break that law or question you, even that doesn’t piss you off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe self-improvement isn’t the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe self-destruction is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you see at fight club is a generation of men raised by women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And the seventh rule,” Tyler yells, “is if this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a thirty-year-old boy, and I’m wondering if another woman is really the answer I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but Tyler explained it all, about not wanting to die without any scars, about being tired of watching only professionals fight, and wanting to know more about himself. About self-destruction. At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing was solved when the fight was over, but nothing mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few fights, you’re afraid a lot less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only after disaster can we be resurrected. “It’s only after you’ve lost everything,” Tyler says, “that you’re free to do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Getting fired,” Tyler says, “is the best thing that could happen to any of us. That way, we’d quit treading water and do something with our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a week after fight club, you’ve got no problem driving inside the speed limit. Maybe you’ve been passing black shit, internal injuries, for two days, but you are so cool. Other cars drive around you. Cars tailgate. You get the finger from other drivers. Total strangers hate you. It’s absolutely nothing personal. After fight club, you’re so relaxed, you just cannot care. You don’t even turn the radio on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanic yells out the window, “As long as you’re at fight club, you’re not how much money you’ve got in the bank. You’re not your job. You’re not your family, and you’re not who you tell yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am stupid, and all I do is want and need things. My tiny life. My little shit job. My Swedish furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You had a near-life experience,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see the strongest and the smartest men who have ever lived,” he says, his face outlined against the stars in the driver’s window, “and these men are pumping gas and waiting tables.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love everything about Tyler Durden, his courage and his smarts. His nerve. Tyler is funny and charming and forceful and independent, and men look up to him and expect him to change their world. Tyler is capable and free, and I am not. I’m not Tyler Durden. “But you are, Tyler,” Marla says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a long enough time line, everyone’s survival rate drops to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How everything you ever love will reject you or die. Everything you ever create will be thrown away. Everything you’re proud of will end up as trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not special. We are not crap or trash, either. We just are. We just are, and what happens just happens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chuck Palahniuk</name></author><summary type="html">This book (and the movie, moreso) had so much hype that I didn’t take it seriously.

&lt;p&gt;If the market for baseball players was inefficient, what market couldn’t be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the enthusiasm for replacing old-school expertise with new-school data analysis was often shallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a review by a pair of academics, then both at the University of Chicago—an economist named Richard Thaler and a law professor named Cass Sunstein. Thaler and Sunstein’s piece, which appeared on August 31, 2003, in the New Republic, managed to be at once both generous and damning. The reviewers agreed that it was interesting that any market for professional athletes might be so screwed-up that a poor team like the Oakland A’s could beat most rich teams simply by exploiting the inefficiencies. But—they went on to say—the author of Moneyball did not seem to realize the deeper reason for the inefficiencies in the market for baseball players: They sprang directly from the inner workings of the human mind. The ways in which some baseball expert might misjudge baseball players—the ways in which any expert’s judgments might be warped by the expert’s own mind—had been described, years ago, by a pair of Israeli psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with uncertainty—about investments or people or anything else—how did it arrive at its conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how did a pair of Israeli psychologists come to have so much to say about these matters that they more or less anticipated a book about American baseball written decades in the future? What possessed two guys in the Middle East to sit down and figure out what the mind was doing when it tried to judge a baseball player, or an investment, or a presidential candidate? And how on earth does a psychologist win a Nobel Prize in economics? In the answers to those questions, it emerged, there was another story to tell. Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Daryl Morey believed—if he believed in anything—in taking a statistically based approach to decision making. And the most important decision he made was whom to allow onto his basketball team. “Your mind needs to be in a constant state of defense against all this crap that is trying to mislead you,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daryl Morey had been the first of his kind: the basketball nerd king. His job was to replace one form of decision making, which relied upon the intuition of basketball experts, with another, which relied mainly on the analysis of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’d always been just the way he was, a person who was happier counting than feeling his way through life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From his stint as a consultant he learned something valuable, however. It seemed to him that a big part of a consultant’s job was to feign total certainty about uncertain things. In a job interview with McKinsey, they told him that he was not certain enough in his opinions. “And I said it was because I wasn’t certain. And they said, ‘We’re billing clients five hundred grand a year, so you have to be sure of what you are saying.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of what people did and said when they “predicted” things, Morey now realized, was phony: pretending to know things rather than actually knowing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suggested a new definition of the nerd: a person who knows his own mind well enough to mistrust it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge is literally prediction,” said Morey. “Knowledge is anything that increases your ability to predict the outcome. Literally everything you do you’re trying to predict the right thing. Most people just do it subconsciously.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick wasn’t just to build a better model. It was to listen both to it and to the scouts at the same time. “You have to figure out what the model is good and bad at, and what humans are good and bad at,” said Morey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I made a new rule right then,” said Morey. “I banned nicknames.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Confirmation bias,” he’d heard this called. The human mind was just bad at seeing things it did not expect to see, and a bit too eager to see what it expected to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morey’s solution was to forbid all intraracial comparison. “We’ve said, ‘If you want to compare this player to another player, you can only do it if they are a different race.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the mind’s best trick of all was to lead its owner to a feeling of certainty about inherently uncertain things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone had been warned; everyone’s minds remained screwed up. Simply knowing about a bias wasn’t sufficient to overcome it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morey thus became aware of what behavioral economists had labeled “the endowment effect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central question posed by Gestalt psychologists was the question the behaviorists had elected to ignore: How does the brain create meaning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, when he was a university professor, Danny would tell students, “When someone says something, don’t ask yourself if it is true. Ask what it might be true of.” That was his intellectual instinct, his natural first step to the mental hoop: to take whatever someone had just said to him and try not to tear it down but to make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He compelled himself to be brave until bravery became a habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The nice thing about things that are urgent,” he liked to say, “is that if you wait long enough they aren’t urgent anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to know how people select a course in life,” Amos said. “The big choices we make are practically random. The small choices probably tell us more about who we are. Which field we go into may depend on which high school teacher we happen to meet. Who we marry may depend on who happens to be around at the right time of life. On the other hand, the small decisions are very systematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By changing the context in which two things are compared, you submerge certain features and force others to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are grouped together for a reason, but, once they are grouped, their grouping causes them to seem more like each other than they otherwise would. That is, the mere act of classification reinforces stereotypes. If you want to weaken some stereotype, eliminate the classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics wasn’t just boring numbers; it contained ideas that allowed you to glimpse deep truths about human life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because we tend to reward others when they do well and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean,” Danny later wrote, “it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reforms always create winners and losers,” Danny explained, “and the losers will always fight harder than the winners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did you get the losers to accept change? The prevailing strategy on the Israeli farms—which wasn’t working very well—was to bully or argue with the people who needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a key idea,” said Danny. “Making it easy to change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information” was a paper, written by Harvard psychologist George Miller, which showed that people had the ability to hold in their short-term memory seven items, more or less. Any attempt to get them to hold more was futile. Miller half-jokingly suggested that the seven deadly sins, the seven seas, the seven days of the week, the seven primary colors, the seven wonders of the world, and several other famous sevens had their origins in this mental truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Belief in the Law of Small Numbers” had raised an obvious next question: If people did not use statistical reasoning, even when faced with a problem that could be solved with statistical reasoning, what kind of reasoning did they use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people make judgments, they argued, they compare whatever they are judging to some model in their minds. How much do those clouds resemble my mental model of an approaching storm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more easily people can call some scenario to mind—the more available it is to them—the more probable they find it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unsuspecting Oregon students, having listened to a list, were then asked to judge if it contained the names of more men or more women. They almost always got it backward: If the list had more male names on it, but the women’s names were famous, they thought the list contained more female names, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Images of the future are shaped by experience of the past,” they wrote, turning on its head Santayana’s famous lines about the importance of history: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What people remember about the past, they suggested, is likely to warp their judgment of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We often decide that an outcome is extremely unlikely or impossible, because we are unable to imagine any chain of events that could cause it to occur. The defect, often, is in our imagination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you are kicking yourself once a month for throwing something away, you are not throwing enough away, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was a classic case of the representativeness heuristic,” said Redelmeier. “You need to be so careful when there is one simple diagnosis that instantly pops into your mind that beautifully explains everything all at once. That’s when you need to stop and check your thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky had pointed out that, while statistically sophisticated people might avoid the simple mistakes made by less savvy people, even the most sophisticated minds were prone to error. As they put it, “their intuitive judgments are liable to similar fallacies in more intricate and less transparent problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When making judgments, people obviously could use help—say, by requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it with you freedom-loving Americans? he asked. Live free or die. I don’t get it. I say, “Regulate me gently. I’d rather live.” His fellow student replied, Not only do a lot of Americans not share your view; other physicians don’t share your view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many sentences popped out of Amos’s mouth that Redelmeier knew he would forever remember: A part of good science is to see what everyone else can see but think what no one else has ever said. The difference between being very smart and very foolish is often very small. So many problems occur when people fail to be obedient when they are supposed to be obedient, and fail to be creative when they are supposed to be creative. The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours. It is sometimes easier to make the world a better place than to prove you have made the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Redelmeier put it, “Last impressions can be lasting impressions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“crucial decisions are made, today as thousands of years ago, in terms of the intuitive guesses and preferences of a few men in positions of authority.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of the decision maker wasn’t to be right but to figure out the odds in any decision and play them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We started with the idea that we should get rid of the usual intelligence report,” said Danny. “Intelligence reports are in the form of essays. And essays have the characteristic that they can be understood any way you damn well please.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The field of decision making explored what people did after they had formed some judgment—after they knew the odds, or thought they knew the odds, or perhaps had judged the odds unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they made decisions, people did not seek to maximize utility. They sought to minimize regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Always keep one hand firmly on data,” Amos liked to say. Data was what set psychology apart from philosophy, and physics from metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you gave a person a choice between a gift of $500 and a 50-50 shot at winning $1,000, he picked the sure thing. Give that same person a choice between losing $500 for sure and a 50-50 risk of losing $1,000, and he took the bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most people, the happiness involved in receiving a desirable object is smaller than the unhappiness involved in losing the same object.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Happy species endowed with infinite appreciation of pleasures and low sensitivity to pain would probably not survive the evolutionary battle,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They feared a one-in-a-billion chance of loss more than they should and attached more hope to a one-in-a-billion chance of gain than they should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their theory explained all sorts of things that expected utility failed to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference point was a state of mind. Even in straight gambles you could shift a person’s reference point and make a loss seem like a gain, and vice versa. In so doing, you could manipulate the choices people made, simply by the way they were described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People did not choose between things. They chose between descriptions of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realized: They had one idea. Which was systematic bias.” If people could be systematically wrong, their mistakes couldn’t be ignored. The irrational behavior of the few would not be offset by the rational behavior of the many. People could be systematically wrong, and so markets could be systematically wrong, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imagination obeyed rules: the rules of undoing. One rule was that the more items there were to undo in order to create some alternative reality, the less likely the mind was to undo them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He helped us to understand why pilots sometimes made bad decisions,” said Maher. “He said, ‘You’re not going to change people’s decision making under duress. You aren’t going to stop pilots from making these mental errors. You aren’t going to train the decision-making weaknesses out of the pilots.’” What Delta Air Lines should do, Amos suggested, was to change its decision-making environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People had trouble seeing when their minds were misleading them; on the other hand, they could sometimes see when other people’s minds were misleading them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to stop the captain from landing the plane in the wrong airport, Amos insisted, was to train others in the cockpit to question his judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That result was all that Danny and Amos needed to make their big point: The rules of thumb people used to evaluate probability led to misjudgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Listen to evolutionary psychologists long enough,” Amos said, “and you’ll stop believing in evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Prospect Theory,” scarcely cited in the first decade after its publication, would become, by 2010, the second most cited paper in all of economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, at the invitation of President Obama, Sunstein went to work at the White House. There he oversaw the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and made scores of small changes that had big effects on the daily lives of all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part of good science is to see what everyone else can see but think what no one else has ever said. Amos had said that to him,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes easier to make the world a better place than to prove you have made the world a better place. Amos had said that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said, ‘Life is a book. The fact that it was a short book doesn’t mean it wasn’t a good book. It was a very good book.’” Amos seemed to understand that an early death was the price of being a Spartan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michael Lewis</name></author><summary type="html">The concept of “Moneyball” has almost become trite.

Our current media culture attempts to explain the world via the last 24 hours in 140 characters. The world appears a lot different with of a little knowledge of the last 6,000 years or 600,000 years for that matter. The Durants offer a remarkably impartial, perhaps amoral, view of human history — while humbly acknowledging that all history is biased. The general thesis that emerges is that times change, but human nature is largely the same. This can be a remarkably optimistic or pessimistic realization. This book can make you feel very small, but it can also remind you that we are standing on the shoulders of giants — we are arguably in the penthouse of civilization. Not a bad place to be.  Things like war, wealth inequality, class warfare, culture changes, changes in leadership, etc., have all happened many times throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History when properly studied is a multi-disciplinary exercise. History is not just names and dates. It’s geology, biology, religion, art, music, politics, science, technology, economics, psychology, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;= = = = =
Quotes
= = = = =&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“History smiles at all attempts to force its flow into theoretical patterns or logical grooves; it plays havoc with our generalizations, breaks all our rules; history is baroque.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human history is a brief spot in space, and its first lesson is modesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence of geographic factors diminishes as technology grows.
So the first biological lesson of history is that life is competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we co-operate in our group-our family, community, club, church, party, “race,” or nation-in order to strengthen our group in its competition with other groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War is a nation’s way of eat- ing. It promotes co-operation because it is the ultimate form of competition.
The second biological lesson of history is that life is selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we knew our fellow men thoroughly we could select thirty per cent of them whose combined ability would equal that of all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utopias of equality are biologically doomed, and the best that the amiable philosopher can hope for is an approximate equality of legal justice and educational opportunity.
The third biological lesson of history is that life must breed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South creates the civilizations, the North conquers them, ruins them, borrows from them, spreads them: this is one summary of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not the race that makes the civilization, it is the civilization that makes the people: circumstances geographical, economic, and political create a culture, and the culture creates a human type.
Society is founded not on the ideals but on the nature of man&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the imitative majority follows the innovating minority&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History in the large is the conflict of minorities; the majority applauds the victor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;out of this tension, as out of the strife of the sexes and the classes, comes a creative tensile strength, a stimulated development, a secret and basic unity and movement of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A larger knowledge stresses the universality of moral codes, and concludes to their necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pugnacity, brutality, greed, and sexual readiness were advantages in the struggle for existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man’s sins may be the relics of his rise rather than the stigmata of his fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industriousness became more vital than bravery, regularity and thrift more profitable than violence, peace more victorious than war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sin has flourished in every age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every age men have been dishonest and governments have been cor- rupt; probably less now than generally before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remind ourselves again that history as usually written (peccavimus) is quite different from history as usually lived: the his- torian records the exceptional because it is interesting-because it is exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile history assures us that civilizations decay quite lei- surely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heaven and utopia are buckets in a well: when one goes down the other goes up; when religion declines Communism grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does history support a belief in God? … the answer must be a reluctant negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nature and history do not agree with our conceptions of good and bad; they define good as that which survives, and bad as that which goes under;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One lesson of history is that religion has many lives, and a habit of resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I do not know what the heart of a rascal may be; I know what is in the heart of an honest man; it is horrible.” - Joseph de Maistre&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no significant example in history, be- fore our time, of a society successfully maintaining moral life without the aid of religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As long as there is poverty there will be gods.”
History, according to Karl Marx, is economics in action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the discovery of America was a result of the failure of the Crusades. (trying to trade with the east)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the men who can manage money manage all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;history is inflationary, and that money is the last thing a \vise man will hoard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;every economic system must sooner or later rely upon some form of the profit motive to stir individuals and groups to productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration of wealth is a natural result of this concentration of ability, and regularly recurs in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good sense prevailed; moderate elements secured the election of Solon … his reforms had saved Athens from revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of the United States, in 1933-52 and 1960-65, fol- lowed Solon’s peaceful methods, and accomplished a moderate and pacifying redistribution;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there have been socialistic experiments in a dozen countries and centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power naturally converges to a center,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to judge forms of government from their prevalence and duration in history we should have to give the palm to monarchy; democracies, by contrast, have been hectic interludes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence most governments have been oligarchies-ruled by a minority&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the majority of abilities is contained in a minority of men, minority government is as inevitable as the concentration of wealth;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in most instances the effects achieved by the revolution would apparently have come without it through the gradual compulsion of economic developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the sanity of a group lies in the continuity of its traditions; in either case a break in the chain invites a neurotic reaction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;violent revolutions do not so much redistribute wealth as destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real revolution is in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character, the only real emancipation is individual, and the only real revolutionists are philosophers and saints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excessive increase of anything causes a reaction in the opposite direction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When money failed, murder was available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every advance in the complexity of the economy puts an added premium upon superior ability, and intensifies the concentration of wealth, responsibility, and political power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All deductions having been made, democracy has done less harm, and more good, than any other form of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If equality of educational opportunity can be established, democracy will be real and justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;democracy is today sounder than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 3,42 I years of recorded history only 268 have seen no war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The causes of war are the same as the causes of competition among individuals: acquisitiveness, pugnacity, and pride; the desire for food, land, materials, fuels, mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the military interpretation of history war is the final arbiter, and is accepted as natural and necessary by all but cowards and simpletons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a philosopher, if he knows history, will admit that a long peace may fatally weaken the martial muscles of a nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general smiles. “You have forgotten all the lessons of history,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we may make contact with ambitious species on other planets or stars; soon thereafter there will be interplanetary war. Then, and only then, will we of this earth be one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have defined civilization as “social order promoting cultural creation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History repeats itself, but only in outline and in the large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History repeats itself in the large because human nature changes with geological leisureliness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one point all are agreed: civilizations begin, flourish, decline, and disappear-or linger on as stagnant pools left by once life-giving streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a challenge successfully met … raises the temper and level of a nation, and makes it abler to meet further challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life has no inherent claim to eternity, whether in individuals or in states. Death is natural, and if it comes in due time it is forgivable and useful, and the mature mind will take no offense from its coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;science is neutral: it will kill for us as readily as it will heal, and will destroy for us more readily than it can build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We double, triple, centuple our speed, but we shatter our nerves in the process, and are the same trousered apes at two thousand miles an hour as when we had legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have we really outgrown intolerance, or merely transferred it from religious to national, ideological, or racial hostilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have we given ourselves more freedom than our intelligence can digest?
History is so indifferently rich that a case for almost any conclusion from it can be made by a selection of instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider education not as the painful accumulation of facts and dates and reigns, nor merely the necessary preparation of the individual to earn his keep in the world, but as the transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage as fully as possible to as many as possible, for the enlargement of man’s understanding, control, embellishment, and enjoyment of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To those of us who study history not merely as a warning reminder of man’s follies and crimes, but also as an encouraging remembrance of generative souls, the past ceases to be a depressing chamber of horrors; it becomes a celestial city, a spacious country of the mind, wherein a thousand saints, statesmen, inventors, scientists, poets, artists, musicians, lovers, and philosophers still live and speak, teach and carve and sing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a man is fortunate he will, before he dies, gather up as much as he can of his civilized heritage and transmit it to his children.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Will and Ariel Durant</name></author><summary type="html">Quite possibly the best book I’ve ever read.
