Earlier this year, my wife and I moved to Nashville, TN. After 30 Michigan winters, I was ready for warmer weather!

Shortly after getting settled in, I found a new job with a healthcare company in downtown Nashville. I'm doing Ruby on Rails development for the company's internal web application.

In addition to moving and new jobs, we did a Vegas/Utah/Arizona road trip (6 national parks), ran some half marathons, and did plenty of kayaking on Percy Priest Lake.

Now I'm enjoying football season and getting ready for a warmer winter in TN.
