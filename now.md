Earlier this year, my wife and I moved to Nashville, TN. After living in MI all my life, it was good time to change things up. We mainly just wanted to escape the cold weather and get a little "life experience" living somewhere else. We're enjoying it so far.

Shortly after getting settled in, I found a new job with a health care company in downtown Nashville. I'm doing front-end and back-end Rails development for an interal web application.

I had originally planned and trained to run the Nashville Rock n' Roll (n√©e Country Music) Marathon in April and the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon in November. However, due to sickness and injury, respectively, I dropped down from the marathon to the half marathon in both events. Fortunately, my troubles were nothing serious, just enough to derail training for a sub-4 hour marathon.
