Earlier this year, my wife and I moved to Nashville, TN. While Michigan had been good to us, we reached a point in our lives that if we were ever going to make a big move, it was a good time to do it.

When deciding to relocate, we considered many, many factors including climate, proximity to family & friends, cost-of-living, economy, size, entertainment & amenities. We chose Nashville among a few finalists. So far we're enjoying our new city: we've made new friends, started new jobs, and kept up with old friends and family.

Shortly after getting settled in, I found a new job with a healthcare company in downtown Nashville. I'm doing front-end and back-end Rails development for the company's internal web application.

My fitness goals for this year included running the Nashville Rock n' Roll (n√©e Country Music) Marathon in April and the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon in November. However, due to sickness and injury, respectively, I dropped down from the marathon to the half marathon in both events.

Fortunately, my troubles were nothing too serious, just enough to derail training for a sub-4 hour marathon. Disappointed, but sometimes things just don't work out. Now I'm enjoying a little "off-season" rest and relaxation before pursuing new goals in the new year.
