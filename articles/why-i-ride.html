				<h1>Why I Ride</h1>
				<h2>A Motorcycle Rider's Manifesto</h2>
			</header>

			<section>
				<p>"Some people die at 25 and aren't buried until 75." - Ben Franklin</p>
				<p>My very favorite thing to do is ride a motorcycle. A vigorous ride on a nice day is one of the finest experiences in life.</p>
				<p>Riding a motorcycle is like living life in high definition. You don't need a speedomotor, you can see the road moving beneath you.</p>
				<p>Riding is exercise, its meditation, its responsible, riding is being alive.</p>
				<p>The key to successful riding is awareness. Awareness. If there is anything modern society lacks, its awareness. How many times in the grocery store do you see people just walk into other people or block the entire aisle simply because they have no awareness.</p>
				<p>We live such insulated lives. I've read a metaphor that riding in a car is like watching a movie, while riding a motorcycle is like being in the movie. When its windy you know it. When something stinks, you know it. You can sense even a few degrees change in temperature.</p>
				<p>Everyone should ride. In a logical world, motorcycles would be the normal mode of transportation, and cars would be the exception.</p>
				<p>I refuse to let the octogenarians who "don't want to be discriminated against", the SUV driving cell phone addicts, and the rest of the idiots win. They can kill me, but they will never win.</p>
				<p>No doubt about it, riding is dangerous. Life is dangerous. The most dangerous thing in life is sitting all day at work, sitting all night at home, watching tv, eating processed food, watching the years just slip on by. Teddy Roosevelt advocated for living a vigorous life. Motorcycling is certainly vigorous.</p>
