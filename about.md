I am a [boring web developer](http://adamsilver.io/articles/the-boring-front-end-developer/). When not tinkering on the computer, I like being active and outside.

Originally from Michigan. Now in Nashville.

## Projects

* Music reference project: [Beyond Tabs](http://rysdyk.com/beyond-tabs)
* Fantasy football draft aid: [Draft Baby](http://rysdyk.com/draft-baby)

## Law

Michigan licensed attorney. Proud to say I passed the unusually difficult [July 2012 Michigan Bar Exam](http://abovethelaw.com/2012/11/test-takers-tank-on-the-july-2012-michigan-bar-exam/). While I enjoyed law school, happy to now be a "retired" lawyer.
