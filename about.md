I am a web developer: Ruby, JS, SQL. When not tinkering on the computer, I try to stay active and get outside.

Originally from Michigan. Now in Nashville.

## Projects

* Fantasy football draft aid: [Draft Baby](http://rysdyk.com/draft-baby)

## Law

Proud to say I passed the semi-infamous [July 2012 Michigan Bar Exam][Bar Exam]. Now, I'm a "retired" lawyer.
