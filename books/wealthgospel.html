      <h1>The Gospel of Wealth by Andrew Carnegie</h1>
      
<br>
"The contrast between the palace of the millionaire and the cottage of the laborer with us today measures the change which has come with civilization. This change, however, is not to be deplored, but welcomed as highly beneficial."
<br><br>
"Much better this great irregularity than universal squalor."
<br><br>
"The 'good old times' were not good old times."
<br><br>
"It is a waste of time to criticize the inevitable."
<br><br>
"[today] the poor enjoy what the rich could not before afford. What were the luxuries have become the necessities of life. The laborer has now more comforts than the farmer had a few generations ago."
<br><br>
"Mutual ignorance breeds mutual distrust."
<br><br>
On the Law of Competition: "It is here; we cannot evade it; no substitutes for it have been found; and while the law may be sometimes hard for the individual, it is best for the race, because it insures survival of the fittest in every department."
<br><br>
"To those who would propose to substitute Communism for this intense Individualism, the answer therefore is: The race has tried that. All progress from that barbarous day to the present time has resulted from its displacement. Not evil, but good, has come to the race from the accumulation of wealth by those who have had the ability and energy to produce it." 
<br><br>
"It is criminal to waste our energies in endeavoring to uproot, when all  we can profitably accomplish is to bend the universal tree of humanity a little in the direction most favorable to the production of good fruit under existing circumstances."
<br><br>
"Individualism, Private Property, the Law of Accumulation of Wealth, and the Law of Competition; for these are the highest result of human experience, the soil in which society, so far, has produced the best fruit. Unequally or unjustly, perhaps, as these laws sometimes operate, and imperfect as they appear to the Idealist, they are, nevertheless, like the highest type of man, the best and most valuable of all that humanity has yet accomplished."
<br><br>
"There are but three modes in which surplus wealth can be disposed of. It can be left to the families of the decedents; or it can be bequeathed for public purposes; or, finally, it can be administered by its possessors during their lives."
<br><br>
"The first [leaving to families of the decedent] is the most injudicious."
<br><br>
"I would as soon leave to my son a curse as the almighty dollar."
<br><br>
"By taxing estates heavily at death the State marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire's unworthy life. It is desirable that nations should go much further in this direction."
<br><br>
The true remedy for inequality of wealth is for the wealthy few to distribute their wealth during their lifetime in big ways. "and this wealth, passing through the hands of the few, can be made a much more potent force for the elevation of our race than if distributed in small sums to the people themselves."
<br><br>
For example, a multimillionaire can build a library "where the treasures the world contained in books will be open to all forever, without money and without price." This result is better than a distributions of small sums.
<br><br>
"This, then, is held to be the duty of the man of wealth: to set an example of modest, unostentatious living, shunning display or extravagance; to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him; and, after doing so, to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds, which he is called upon to administer â€¦ to produce the most beneficial results for the community."
<br><br>
"It were better for mankind that the millions of the rich were thrown into the sea than so spent as to encourage the slothful, the drunken, the unworthy. Of every thousand dollars spend in so-called charity today, it is probable that nine hundred and fifty dollars is unwisely spent -- so spent, indeed, as to produce the very evils which it hopes to mitigate or cure."
<br><br>
"In bestowing charity, the main consideration should be to help those who help themselves;"
<br><br>
"Neither the individual nor the race is improved by almsgiving. Those worthy of assistance, except in rare cases, seldom require assistance. The really valuable men of the race never do, except in case of accident or sudden change."
<br><br>
The best means of benefitting the community is through free libraries, parks, museums where the public can benefit in mind, body and taste.
<br><br>
"the millionaire will be a trustee for the poor."
<br><br>
"The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced."
