      <h1>The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley</h1>
      <br>
By virtually every standard the world is getting better with time.
<br>
<br>
Its easy to get nostalgic about simpler times living in the cabin in the woods. But you have to remember that kids often died, tooth aches didn't go away, you worked hard, manual labor until you died, and your mattress was made of straw… if it was nice.
<br>
<br>
Self-Sufficiency is not the route to prosperity.
<br>
<br>
People criticized the French kings for having others prepare his meals. Yet, the average american can afford to have somebody else prepare all his meals.
<br>
<br>
Organized effort is true power and wealth.
<br>
<br>
Why did humans go from hunter gathers in constant state of tribal warfare to modern civilization. Some people have argued it was climate or genetics or "culture". Ridley argues it was simply economics. Its a lot easier to divide labor and exchange resources and services
<br>
<br>
"But I am saying that barter -- the simultaneous exchange of different objects -- was itself a human breakthrough, perhaps even the chief thing that led to the ecological dominance and burgeoning material prosperity of the species. Fundamentally, other animals do not do barter." [other animals do not reciprocate, i will scratch your back if you scratch mine -- literally, but that's about it]
<br>
<br>
"True barter requires that you give up something you value in exchange for something else you value slightly more." Chimps will trade food they do not like for food they do like. But they will not trade food they like for food they like even better.
<br>
<br>
Ricardo's Law has been called the only proposition in the whole of the social sciences that is both true and surprising. 
<br>
<br>
Isolated people don't develop or innovate
<br>
<br>
"Isolation -- self-sufficiency -- caused the shriveling of their technology." Talking about Tasmanian regress.
<br>
<br>
"People are surprisingly good at guessing who to trust."
<br>
<br>
"'The success of trust-based peer organizations such as eBay, wikipedia, and the open-source movement, indicates that trust is a highly expandable network property.'" - John Clippinger
<br>
<br>
"The internet, in other words, may be the best forum for crime, but it is also the best forum for free and fair exchange the world has ever seen."
<br>
<br>
"'Trust matters… Before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it . . . because a man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom.'"
<Br>
<br>
In the stone age we lived in a zero-sum world, in which one person's gain mean another person's loss. That's not the case anymore. "The notion of synergy, of both sides benefitting, just does not seem to come naturally to people."
<br>
<br>
"Like biological evolution, the market is a bottom-up world with nobody in charge."
<br>
<br>
"Nobody planned the global capitalist system, nobody runs it, and nobody really comprehends it. This particularly offends intellectuals, for capitalism renders them redundant. It gets on perfectly well without them." - Peter Saunders
<br>
<br>
"The intelligentsia has disdained commerce through Western history."
<br>
<br>
"Voltaire points out that people who would otherwise have tried to kill each other for worshipping the wrong god were civil when they met on the floor of the Exchange in London."
<br>
<br>
Perhaps its no coincidence that with the rise of industrial age that public execution and slavery and child labor disappeared. Perhaps its not coincidence that wit the rise of the business age and information age that racism, sexism, and child abuse are unacceptable.
<br>
<br>
"There is a direct link between commerce and virtue."
<br>
<br>
"those of libertarian bent often prove more generous than those of a socialist persuasion: where the socialist feels that it is government's job to look after the poor using taxes, libertarians think it is their duty."
<br>
<br>
Crime rates have plummeted in the 21st century.
<br>
<br>
"The American civil rights movement drew its strength partly from a great economic migration. More African-Americans left the South between 1940 and 1970 than Poles, Jews, Italians or Irish had arrived in America as immigrants during their great migrations."
<br>
<br>
Opportunities to work outside the home, and the invention of appliances, allowed for women to get out of the home and gain equal rights.
<br>
<br>
"Tomorrow's largely self-employed workers, clocking on to work online in bursts for different clients when and where it suits them, will surely look back on the days of bosses and foremen, of meetings and appraisals, of time sheets and trade unions, with amusement."
<br>
<br>
"When commerce thrives, creativity and compassion both flourish." Go ask Aristotle, Michelangelo, Galileo, Newton and Darwin who foot the bills for their work.
<br>
<br>
"The behavior of Hongwu, the first of the Ming emperors, is an object lesson in how to stifle the economy: forbid all trade and travel without government permission; force merchants to register an inventory of their goods once a month; order peasants to grow for their own consumption and not for the market; and allow inflation to devalue the paper current 10,000 fold. His son Yong-le added some more items to the list: move the capital at vast expense; maintain a gigantic army; invade Vietnam unsuccessfully… [and] ban everybody else from building ships or trading abroad."
<br>
<br>
"The message from history is so blatantly obvious -- that free trade causes mutual prosperity while protectionism causes poverty -- that it seems incredible that anybody ever thinks otherwise."
<br>
<br>
"Yes, of course, trade is disruptive. Cheap imports can destroy jobs at home -- though in doing so they always create far more both at home and abroad, by freeing up consumers' cash to buy other goods and services."
<br>
<br>
"Renewables are not green." - Jesse Ausubel
<br>
<br>
"just one wind farm at Altamont in California kills twenty-four golden eagles every year: if an oil firm did that it would be in court."
<br>
<br>
"Civilisation, like life itself, has always been about capturing energy."
<br>
<br>
"People don't like change . . and the notion that technology is exciting is true for only a handful of people. The rest are depressed or annoyed by the changes." - Michael Crichton
<br>
<br>
Technology usually precedes science. The inventors of the steam engine knew very little scientific theory. "even today scientists' job is really to come along and explain the empirical findings of technological tinkerers after they have discovered something." 
<br>
<br>
Technology has done more to raise our standards of living than science has. "Aspirin was curing headaches for more than a century before anybody had the faintest idea of how." "Food was being preserved by canning long before anybody had any germ theory to explain why it helped."
<br>
<br>
Big firms often miss opportunities. "That is why Apply, not IBM, perfected the personal computer, why the Wright brothers, not the French army, invented powered flight, why Jonas Salk, not the British National Health Service, invented a polio vaccine, why Amazon, not the Post Office, invented one-click ordering and why a Finnish lumber-supply company, not a national telephone monopoly, became the world leader in mobile telephony."
<br>
<br>
"No charity ever raised money for its cause by saying things are getting better. No journalist every got the front page by telling his editor that he wanted to write a story about how disaster was now less likely. Good news is no news."
<br>
<br>
Pessimists can be right sometimes. Too few people listened to anxieties about Hitler, Mao, Al-Qaeda and subprime mortgages.
<br>
<br>
Africa has receive billions in foreign aid over the last 2+ decades, yet economic growth has fallen to zero.
<br>
<br>
"Grandiose goals and centralized plans have just as long and just as disastrous a history in aid as they do in politics. Nobody planned the industrial revolution, or China's economic surge. The planners' role was to get out of the way of bottom-up evolutionary solutions."
<br>
<br>
Incidentally, private property is a great way to protect natural resources. "Give local people the power to own, exploit and profit from natural resources in a sustainable way and they will usually preserve and cherish those resources."
<br>
<br>
If you really want to help poor people in poor countries, work to fight hunger, dirty water, indoor smoke and malaria. Keeping emissions at 1990 levels isn't going to do much.
<br>
<br>
"A child that dies from indoor smoke in a village denied fossil fuel electricity is just as great a tragedy as a child that dies in a flood caused by climate change."
<br>
<br>
Fossil Fuels were perhaps the biggest factor in ending slavery. Energy from slave labor was too expensive compared to energy from fossil fuel.
<br>
<br>
The best way to go low carbon is nuclear. Nothing is as efficient at producing energy as nuclear. Waste amounts to a coke can per person per lifetime. Nuclear waste gets safer with time, unlike most other toxins.
<br>
<br>
Modern nuclear power plants are as different from Chernobyl plants modern jet airliners are from bi-planes.
<br>
<br>
"People are willing to share their photographs on Flickr, their thoughts on Twitter, their friends on Facebook, their knowledge on Wikipedia, their software patches on linux, their donations on Globalgiving, their community news on Craigslist, their pedigrees on Ancestry.com, their genomes on 23andMe, even their medical records on Patientslikeme. Thanks to the internet, each is giving according to his ability to each according to his needs, to a degree that never happened in Marxism."
<br>
<br>
"So long as human exchange and specialization are allowed to thrive somewhere, then culture evolves whether leaders help it or hinder it, and the result is that prosperity spreads, technology progresses, poverty declines, disease retreats, fecundity falls, happiness increases, violence atrophies, freedom grows, knowledge flourishes, the environment improves and wilderness expands."
<br>
<br>
"The twenty-first century will be a magnificent time to be alive."
<br>
