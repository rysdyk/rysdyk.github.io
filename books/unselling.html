    <h1>Unselling: Selling Less to Win More by Peter Bourke</h1>
<br />
<br />
	<p>I can confidently say that TCS has developed the most effective sales methods and tools to help sales people and teams to win deals they can’t afford to lose.</p>
	<p>When a sales person “sells,” the prospective buyer has an immediate negative reaction.</p>
	<p>What the buyer often wants, in order to achieve the above objectives, is a buyer-seller relationship that is best described as “subservient.”</p>
	<p>A subservient sales person doesn’t ask challenging questions of the prospect; they don’t challenge their assumptions; and they really don’t add much value to the client’s evaluation and decision process – and therein lies the problem with the subservient sales model.</p>
	<p>In reality, “selling”, in the traditional sense, actually precludes your ability to do these things well. The less we sell, the more likely we are to win the prospect’s business. If that sounds completely counter-intuitive – let’s shift gears and talk about the tools and techniques (and the logic) to do this well.</p>
	<p>The challenge with the “selling” approach is that the more we sell, the less we collaborate with the client (and the less they share). And the less we collaborate, the less we really understand the problem the prospect is trying to solve.</p>
	<p>“Regardless of whom you evaluate and ultimately choose, you may want to consider the following criteria in your evaluation of all of your options…”</p>
	<p>“We may or may not be the optimum solution for your needs but the better I understand the business problem you’re intent on solving, the better I can help you assess whether we have a good fit.”</p>
	<p>“If I were in your position, before looking seriously at buying this new application for your business, I’d first determine if it makes sense to change from what you’re using today.”</p>
	<p>Our goal in UnSelling is to minimize (perhaps even eliminate) all surprises. Instead of hoping that bad news won’t come up, we proactively ensure that it does.</p>
	<p>Remember, this is all about the client’s success – not ours!
	</p>
	<p>The more you know, the less likely you are to lean on the “selling” crutch of your solution’s features and functions (a brochure as an example) to have a dialogue and the more likely you are to have a business discussion.</p>
	<p>I recently read that if you read 3 books on any given topic you would be more knowledgeable than 95% of the U.S. population on that topic.</p>
	<p>If you act like an executive and become an expert on their business you’ll have a far better opportunity to gain their confidence… and their vote!</p>
	<p>I hope the theme that’s obvious is that our clients deserve the truth. Even if it’s hard for us to admit the truth.</p>
	<p>when we make the client believe that the project implementation will be straightforward and easily achievable, we actually accomplish the opposite unintended consequence: the prospect buys into the notion that anyone can do it well which serves to advantage our often-lower-price competitor.</p>
	<p>The UnSelling professional looks at this strategy very differently. We adopt the philosophy that effective selling is entirely about the client’s success, regardless of whether we are the chosen solution provider.</p>
