    <h1>I Was Blind But Now I See by James Altucher</h1>
<br />
<br />
	<p>THE PATH TO HAPPINESS INVOLVES BEING AS HEALTHY AS WE CAN: PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY, MENTALLY, AND SPIRITUALLY.</p>
	<p>Follow these ten ideas with discipline (described more throughout the book) and you will make more money than you know what to do with. This world is filled with money. The global economy is over $50 trillion dollars.</p>
	<p>The American Religion needs you to be in debt. Needs you to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to read the same Plato you could’ve read in the bathroom at your local library.</p>
	<p>And note that the slaves weren’t released until 1862, when Lincoln, who couldn’t care less about them, was afraid we were going to lose the Civil War, a war fought over whether or not the North could still control the tariffs of the Southern cotton when the Southern states seceded (as was their right).</p>
	<p>But stocks are rigged. I’ve seen it too many times I’ve seen the rigging happen right in front of me. It’s not the path to wealth.</p>
	<p>The best thing you can do is avoid all news.</p>
	<p>For instance, computer programming is best learned on the job.</p>
	<p>But the important point is this: why was this guy so proud to be a “Democrat” and so eager to label me something else. We label ourselves because we want to be part of something we perceive as better than us as an individual. We can’t handle our individuality, the strength of ourselves as a single human.</p>
	<p>Here’s what’s really defending my way of life. Not somebody fighting in a jungle in Vietnam or Afghanistan but global capitalism. The more we trade and do business and support the economic development of third world countries, the less likely they are to want to bomb us (which has happened once in 50 years and not by a country but by a terrorist group that we successfully fought more through seizing bank accounts than through military actions).</p>
	<p>IDEAS. Find your “customers.” Treat yourself like a one-man business. Make a list of customers (i.e. places or people you might want to work with). Then come up with a list of 10 ideas for each customer/place you might want to work. Ideas that can make them money. This way you keep your idea muscle intact. Don’t let your idea muscle atrophy! Pitch your ideas to that customer if you can. If you can’t move onto the next customer. But wait until tomorrow. You did your thing for today. Be proud. THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS. It has worked for me.</p>
	<p>RULE #1: LOVE THE PRODUCT. You have to love the current output of the company.</p>
	<p>RULE #2: KNOW THE HISTORY.</p>
	<p>RULE #3: KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE EXECUTIVES.</p>
	<p>RULE #4: MAKE YOUR BOSS LOOK GOOD.</p>
	<p>RULE #5: KNOW ALL THE SECRETARIES.</p>
	<p>RULE #6: CONSTANTLY TEST YOUR VALUE ON THE MARKET.</p>
	<p>By the way, if you ask someone to lunch, why would they say yes? Often I would do it under the guise of either, “I’d like to ask you for advice” or “I have ideas for you.” It’s hard for people to say “no” to either of those. Promise you will keep it short, and stick to it. One hour.</p>
	<p>RULE #9: BECOME THE COMPANY.</p>
	<p>Ideas are a dime a dozen. And execution is worth a million dollars. And I mean that specifically, if you execute on a good idea, you’ll make a million dollars or more from it.</p>
	<p>What impressed me about that is that honest, sincere voices will always rise to the top. When you are fearless and fierce, you will shine.</p>
	<p>The key is: every day try to make some improvement in the following areas: PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL.</p>
	<p>All you need to do, minimally, is exercise enough to break a sweat for 10 minutes. So about 20-30 minutes worth of exercise a day. This is not to get “ripped” or “shredded.” But just to be healthy. You can’t be happy if you aren’t healthy.</p>
	<p>You want to have high quality of life until you die. Making sure your bones are fine, making sure your spine is straight, making sure your digesting is going well, making sure you get enough sleep, these are all important things.</p>
	<p>Energy leaks out of you if someone is draining you. And I never owe anyone an explanation. Explaining is draining.</p>
	<p>The Four Types of People #1 HAPPY. There are people who are genuinely happy in the world.</p>
	<p>But for you to go from success to success you must first be sincerely happy for the people who are happy around you. You don’t have to love them. But don’t resent them.</p>
	<p>#2 PEOPLE IN PAIN.</p>
	<p>Be compassionate but keep your boundaries. Your goal is your own peace of mind throughout the day, so you can focus on your own success. The fastest way to do that is show compassion to those less fortunate. What you give, comes back tenfold. Try this exercise: picture everyone in your life who is unhappy or in pain, spend five minutes picturing them in a happier state. This trains your mind.</p>
	<p>#3 GOOD PEOPLE.</p>
	<p>#4 CRAPPY PEOPLE: PEOPLE WHO WILL DO YOU HARM, no matter what you do, for no reason at all.</p>
	<p>COMPLETELY IGNORE THE EVIL PEOPLE: COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM. DON’T THINK ABOUT THEM. DON’T TALK TO THEM. DON’T WRITE THEM. MOST IMPORTANT: DON’T GIVE THEM ADVICE. They will NEVER listen to your advice. It’s arrogant and stupid to think they will.</p>
	<p>If someone says, “what do you think of so-and-so,” your worst enemy, you say back, “SO-AND-SO WHO?” And that’s it. No explanation. Nothing more. “So and so who?” Then change subject right away.</p>
	<p>IF SOMEONE IS CRAPPY TO YOU, THEY ARE NOT WORTH YOUR COMPASSION.</p>
	<p>DON’T READ NEWSPAPERS. All they do is bring you more fear.</p>
	<p>DON’T WATCH TV. Jealousy, greed, anger, murder are the themes of the top TV shows. And then there’s the news.</p>
	<p>It’s common now for divorce lawyers to ask new clients, is your husband or wife spending a lot of time on Facebook.</p>
	<p>This always happens. 99% of the things we fear never happen.</p>
	<p>LAZINESS. Everyone is lazy some of the time. If I am bored with something I’m lazy. But with a startup, or if you are trying to move up in the corporate world, or if you are falling in love with a girl, you can’t be lazy.</p>
	<p>FEAR IS THE ENEMY OF HONESTY. Not lack of wealth. Fear of losing clients. Fear of pissing off family. Fear of going to hell. Fear people won’t like you. Fear of being alone. I very much have these fears.</p>
	<p>But fear never made anyone money or anyone happier or healthier.</p>
	<p>"these are the real people and I’m faking it.”</p>
	<p>Airbnb is only the start. Zillow is only the start. There’s a million ways. Take any topic that is practically a religious topic. Say out loud, “the way the world does this right now is bull-shit” and start thinking “why” and “how” to make it better.</p>
